Blick,"From Reuters

Amid the wild price fluctuations, the amount of position covering last week by U.S. hedge funds, buying and selling, was the highest since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Nevertheless, their market exposure to stocks is still near record levels, the investment bank warned.

""According to Goldman Sachs Prime Services, this week represented the largest active hedge fund de-grossing since February 2009. Funds in their coverage sold long positions and covered shorts in every sector,"" the investment bank wrote in a note late on Friday.

""Despite this active deleveraging, hedge fund net and gross exposures on a mark-to-market basis both remain close to the highest levels on record, indicating ongoing risk of positioning-driven sell-offs.""",1612150846,glk40uj,28,wallstreetbets

***Volkswagen Infinity Squeeze.***  The October 2008 short squeeze on shares of Volkswagen AG has since been referred to as the “Mother of all Squeezes”. It was also perhaps the earliest use of the term “Infinity Squeeze”.  It was during the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and Volkswagen was increasingly being viewed as a potential bankruptcy candidate.  In other words, Volkswagen was viewed as an exceptionally attractive short candidate.  However, at very depth of the crisis, an orchestrated short squeeze on VW shares caused VW to briefly become the most valuable company in the world, worth more by market cap than Exxon Mobil.",1612150850,glk414y,2,wallstreetbets

stho3,"A head hunter reached out to me via LinkedIn back in the fall of 2019 about a role with Citadel. I took the phone call wanting to learn more about the opportunity but in the end, I told the head hunter I wasn't interested. Fast forward to March of 2020, a recruiter from Citadel reached out to me about a position that I had applied for back in the summer of 2019--a position I had totally forgotten about. To be perfectly honest, I didn't really prepare for the interview because this was right around the time when COVID raging on and WFH just started, I spoke with the hiring manager and she told me that she was given authority to build her team up from scratch and she thought I would be a good fit based on my resume. I guess I must have bombed the interview because I received a rejection email from the recruiter a couple of weeks later. LOL",1612150865,glk4284,1,wallstreetbets

Silver Thursday was an event that occurred in the United States silver commodity markets on Thursday, March 27, 1980, following the attempt by brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt and Lamar Hunt to corner the silver market. A subsequent steep fall in silver prices led to panic on commodity and futures exchanges.

They can do a lot with it.

They lend that shit out. ESPECIALLY when they are making 30% (GME share borrow rate) interest on those shares.

Think of it this way. You have your money in a bank account.  Bank uses your money to loan out to whatever - mortgages, business loans, etc.

SkyBIueDreams,"Here’s why we are green (and will stay green throughout the remainder of the day) for those curious. Notice how SPY and the market as whole went down pretty bad Wed-Fri. That was hedge funds liquidating big time, because none of them have the capital on hand to cover their shorts. Billions of dollars of equity was liquidated last week. What you are seeing now is some hedge funds buying back in at the lower price, to hopefully sell later for higher so that they can liquidate MORE to cover more shorts, assuming the short data that we have on GME is true. Hedge funds will basically play chicken for a while, liquidating/buying back in, all trying to sell higher to the others.

***Volkswagen Infinity Squeeze.***  The October 2008 short squeeze on shares of Volkswagen AG has since been referred to as the “Mother of all Squeezes”. It was also perhaps the earliest use of the term “Infinity Squeeze”.  It was during the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and Volkswagen was increasingly being viewed as a potential bankruptcy candidate.  In other words, Volkswagen was viewed as an exceptionally attractive short candidate.  However, at very depth of the crisis, an orchestrated short squeeze on VW shares caused VW to briefly become the most valuable company in the world, worth more by market cap than Exxon Mobil.",1612150969,glk49su,1,wallstreetbets

WilleZumLeben,"With the volume of people leaving Robinhood or not actively trading, it has a better chance of surviving the traffic squeeze during periods of high volatility. Having orders placed in a timely manner could be the make-it-or-break-it. A broker that won't let you buy stonks won't be around for long. But for right now, transferring an entire portfolio isn't pragmatic for most people. Lower traffic has its advantages. There are plenty of other great UI's out there. The UI never factored into the decision for me because it is absolutely terrible contrary to what you say. The option chain is terrible, the watchlists are now terrible and hard to organize. Selling order flow, missing out on free L2 data, and horrible fills which cost you money are just the shit-cherry on top.

 💎🙌  Your post /u/vinlo and [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnnydaggers/)   makes the most sense to add to this  💎🙌 

I wanted to Ask the Question \*""Is it possible that Melvin has exited?""\*

Caveat Emptors to this analysis:

💎 Relies on Ortex's Estimated Data, which can easily have large variance with Actual #s, and will be influenced by all manipulation Thursday/Friday

💎 Assumes most short positions are avg of 20 Dollars, based on Citron's Tweets from Earlier in Month

💎 Assumes Melvin's 7.4 billion loss is accurate

💎 everything I did is probably wrong

&amp;#x200B;

The only conclusion I can make here is Melvin is fully lying regarding the 22-Jan Exit if the loss was real; No way to have exited that early in the Game and then later announced a 7.4 Billion Loss

MindofLogic23,"Nice song mate

For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, you'll be taxed on realized gains once you sell the stock. Weigh your risk tolerance on if you want to transfer the stocks or liquidate. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert. 

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

Usual-Championship88,"I want AMC to rise as much as everyone else (if not more) but I refuse to worship false idols even if it’s a joke .... may we all get together and be one!!  - 

I wrote this Piece on AMC a few days ago and I hope everyone reads its now !! 

I wrote this a couple days ago but feel like people should still read this if they haven’t and are in on AMC - everyone needs to do their part on social media!!!!! 

AMC - it is a company that has been around since 1920, survive the Great Depression, WW2 &amp; The 08 recession .. with the vaccines rolling out in the hundreds of millions, our economy is going to start to re open and people are going to want to go to the movies (cabin fever anyone?). Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when it’s low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Don’t panic, never sell low! I know you’ve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we aren’t selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media it’s Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the 🚀 to the 🌝 !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! don’t get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they can’t do something ie. “You can’t buy but you can sell” (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more. DONT BE AFRAID, we are in this war together. We may not win every battle, but we WILL win the war ! Too much publicity not to at this point. See you guys on the moon.  💎  🙌",1612151153,glk4mp9,28,wallstreetbets

***Volkswagen Infinity Squeeze.***  The October 2008 short squeeze on shares of Volkswagen AG has since been referred to as the “Mother of all Squeezes”. It was also perhaps the earliest use of the term “Infinity Squeeze”.  It was during the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and Volkswagen was increasingly being viewed as a potential bankruptcy candidate.  In other words, Volkswagen was viewed as an exceptionally attractive short candidate.  However, at very depth of the crisis, an orchestrated short squeeze on VW shares caused VW to briefly become the most valuable company in the world, worth more by market cap than Exxon Mobil.",1612151162,glk4nbs,5,wallstreetbets

Best advice I can give tho is stay away from mainstream brands (Acer (predator), msi, asus, razer, alienware) they are overpriced, I dont know any company that builds laptops in NA, I know that in EU you can get it from PCZ where I got mine and they are awsome.

They keep telling me it’s because they restricted it, yet i’ve got an open order for AMC that they haven’t deleted even though they say they can’t excute that either. So I keep asking why are you honouring one and deleting the other from my account.

Then they tell me it’s because I put the order in after they restricted trading... but I put it in on FRIDAY AND YOU STOPED TRADING ON SATURDAY!

HOW AM I MEANT TO “LEVERAGE” MYSELF UP TO MY TITS!!! if you shit gibbons wont give me stonk!!!

is anyone accepting buy orders any more? how the fuck is city group doing this... also HOW THE FUCK IS AN MM UNABLE TO BUY 3 shares.

telperiontree,"So a hedge fund owns 100 percent of a stock. They lend 30 percent of them out to a short, who sells them to another institution. Suddenly, the original hedge fund and the new institution both own THE SAME STOCK. And now the percent of institutional ownership of the stock is... 130 percent. 

This is what massive short selling looks like. 

The price fluctuations/short laddering/ low volume bullshit we've seen the past few days were all fake, synthetic shares. They're trading shit that doesn't exist. 

Naked short selling is when you take the above 130 percent scenario, and have the second institution decide to lend out their shares to another shorter. That shorter sells it to Ryan Cohen. Now you have the hedge fund, the institution, and RC all owning the stock for 160 percent of shares in existence. 

On and on we go. So the original short gets margin called. They have to buy back 30 percent of the shares in existence. If they buy it from RC, the second shorter is fucked because the high price means he will get margin called. If they buy it from the institution, the second shorter should be fucked because the institution needs the shares it lent out back. 

Shorts get fucked, longs get paid, stock market crashes because shorts get fucked. Ta da.

d-redze,"I also have a confession. I to was a doubter. I was dumb. I didn’t think a “short squeeze” could happen for real. 
I was warning people about the boomer argument when I saw post about it months ago.  I didn’t understand the turn around potential.(I think the fundamentals for a great company turn around are at least in part what is making this squeeze successful or at least let it take off.) 
   But the fact Is I talked a buddy out of buying at 4$ a share. I was short sighted. Then GME went up to 12$, then 20$, then 40$. At 40$ I was like, hold on, what’s happening. I dug in and started believing in the turn around potential.I though “ well good for them”.  Then at 58$ I realize this fabled “short squeeze” might not be a fairy tail. I then bough in with 1/2 my portfolio lol.  I saw what happened to Tesla and said every day I wish I could have got in on that (you probably still can). But something told me don’t miss this one to. I can’t say how grateful I am for this opportunity and my chance to be apart of it. I can’t express how sorry I am for being a doubter or hater.  If I cause even one person to sell a single share with my uninformed opinion it will have been to many. But! We are here now, and we must keep looking forward to the future!  💎🙌🚀🚀.

poopiedoodles,"Hello accountant, I keep seeing how much we'll all be paying in taxes for potential earnings on short-term positions, but isn't it just the same as our income tax brackets? Not to imply that isn’t a considerable amount, but not entirely unexpected. There’s no taxes beyond that afaik, correct? Also, can’t we write losses off (up to like 2k-3k) off our taxes? Read in some places you had to have a margin account to do so and others cash accounts were eligible as well. I’d guess if you’re obligated to pay them, you’re eligible to write them off as well. Unless not everyone has to pay taxes on stock earnings. By the way Covid’s going, not looking like there’ll be too much by the way of the typical flights/hotels/etc to write off in 2021, sooo might as well view any potential losses as my contribution to my 2022 tax return.",1612151331,glk4zpc,3,wallstreetbets

Why do you think this?

The only thing that drives stocks up or down is whether buyers outnumber sellers or vice versa at the given price point.

JLewiMui,"As a result of this information.. Can't the market crash?

Would it be possible for the SEC to backtrack the naked shorts and remove them from the system? Obviously, causing jail time for the orchestrators but also crashing the market?

Alternatively, could they remove all naked shorts from their holders and then force Gamestop to actualize the shares thereby dropping the value of all GME shares by the percentage of created shares?

It also sounds like a third option of freezing the market is possible.. which would have catastrophic results all around. 

This is actually a global issue and a revolution. You retards are making history.

What are the actual implications of this info?

It was also perhaps the earliest use of the term “Infinity Squeeze”.  It was during the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and Volkswagen was increasingly being viewed as a potential bankruptcy candidate.  In other words, Volkswagen was viewed as an exceptionally attractive short candidate.

Real_Durindana,"Yes, there have been indications all last week that short HFs were rolling and not exiting. 

OTOH, there are long HFs playing ball now too who smell blood - that’s who rolled in a fuckton of buy 5 minutes to close Friday. Retail didn’t do shit Thursday or Friday, so there is a lot of Wall Street money between 250 and 300. And those folks have a ton of dry powder and even better an entire army of new tards banging on the doors at open Monday

My feel is that long HFs don’t want a war of attrition, the shorts would take that eventually on the back of retail tards. Instead I suspect pre-market is going to see at first a brutal dip - driven by short algos and abetted by longs seeking alpha on the upside - followed by a lull while long Wall Street gauges how hard the tards hold, and then a calibrated and sustained buying pressure from long HFs to shoot the moon, ASAP, with retail FOMOing in along the way and then (ideally from the street’s perspective) bag holding when it’s all over",1612151376,glk534o,11,wallstreetbets

I could have worked as a developer at a FANG shop, not trying to brag but I'm fucking good at what I do, but I moved to a mid sized city and took a job there. My two bedroom apartment is like 10% of my salary, there's plenty of good food and things to do, my commute (when that was a thing) is only 20 minutes and the work life balance is phenomenal. When I finish my work, that's it. I'm done. Go home. No pressure to strain myself and burn the candle from both ends, even indirectly.

Shit just I finished a big project that I had to do by myself (small company and we were all busy), and he just told me to fuck off for the rest of the week. Don't put in for PTO.

I fucking love my job.

Meanwhile I've got friends who work at Google and while they do enjoy their work, they've got a lot more stress and a lot less free time.

I also had friends who worked for Amazon. Never work for Amazon.

I'm not against community investment nor TIF's.  But there needs to be guarantees from the corporation that the community invests in. If those guarantees are not fulfilled, then monetary penalties...not just pulling funds back, but actual penalties that would motivate the company to fulfill those requirements.

When TIF's began to get popular in smaller towns, back in the 80s &amp; 90s...there were small call center operations that would pop up, hire 10 house wives in town for part time work.  After 6 months to a year of city paid rent, utilities and equipment...they'd find another town to sucker for free stuff.

America was at its strongest financially across the widest swaths of people when the marginal tax rate was in the 70-90% range. The continued erosion of the marginal tax rate has lead to a far greater amount of Americans being wildly poor.

No American should have to go without food, a home, a job, or healthcare. We can guarantee all of those with a high marginal tax rate.

Sign waiver understanding your risk with your brokerage and it all goes.  Regardless of what you or anyone else feels entitled to opine.  

Attempting to regulate speculative momentum trades or politically motivated trades (or squelch it like you are) is against free market principles.  The fact that Robinhood’s dabbling in doing so may have already shaken market confidence beyond repair should be evidence enough.

rightovahere,"Are we at the phase where we're realistic about risk management yet, or are we still on the ""mOoN"" phase of GME?

Normally I'd be ecstatic to watch the loss porn as old WSB was just fellow 20yr old tech yuppies with money to burn, but after reading that IRL stories megathread I think I'm just going to be sad. Way too many non-WSB here in dire straights looking for GME to change their lives, buying in at $250+. When(not if) this goes tits up, this can and likely will drop a lot faster than you think.

Just FYI:

* Ortex GME short interest estimate is now down to 38m as of Friday, from 70m+.

* A big aspect of short squeezes is multiple days to cover, which is non-existent for GME at this stage. Daily volume hit 300% of float for multiple days in a row. Even with depressed volume on Thu/Fri, its still over 100% of outstanding short interest, per Ortex

* Fair or not, Robinhood is still hard limiting purchases and likely contributed to a significant amount of short covering last Thursday.

World: Yeah, But this hedge fund, has pockets deeper than we can imagine.

WSB: Yes, well, he's never held against me.

World: Yes, he has.

WSB: He's never held against me twice, and we're getting all those options excericed in the morning

World: well, they better let everybody buy those shares.

WSB: You know, I'm 1500 dollars in. I've lost  twice as much as that. And every one of those dollars could've gone towards my rent.  I'm only holding because fate wants me alive. Citadel  is just the latest of a long line of bastards, and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance - fate wills it so.

LactobaSILLY,"It’s obvious they (Melvin, citron, citadel) got some psychologists in the mix now to capitalize on the people who are like “omg what’s the next GameStop these people will squeeze next week?!?!” To get in FOMO and late to the game players. They’re using your psychology against you via experts. There will ***never*** be a squeeze like GME again. It will be regulated and rules changed after (maybe before who knows, thanks Robinhood) to prevent it. There will be some, that’s part of the market. But this magnitude will not be seen. Especially not this week with a new ticker. These funds have huge amounts of puts sold to a stock. So now they’re reversing what’s happened and trying to say “it’ll rocket” with a fake account that looks like it’s on our side, because they believe it’ll rocket and they’re using you because they’ve seen the massive effect we all can have. Don’t fall for it, don’t be an idiot. They do not care about your interests, only theirs. 

Tldr: the same people we’re battling against in GME have seen the collective power of retards and now reversed the idea in other stocks. Publish things as “individuals” looking like us, to make you play into them. They’ll get out at the top, you won’t.",1612151600,glk5j2h,2,wallstreetbets

Marble fountains flanking the front door. Your friend works at an auto body shop, so this is somewhat unexpected.

You enter. Hanging prominently in the foyer in an ornately carved wooden frame: this picture. The host greets you and compliments the diamond tattoo on your hand.

MediaCorrectness,"Bro, no lie. I'm going to need to draw this out, it's so hard to follow.

“There are 100 shares. A owns 90 of them, B owns 10. A lends her 90 shares to C, who shorts them all to D. Now A owns 90 shares, B owns 10 and D owns 90—there are 100 shares outstanding, but 190 shares show up on ownership lists. (The accounts balance because C owes 90 shares to A, giving C, in a sense, negative 90 shares.) Short interest is 90 shares out of 100 outstanding. Now D lends her 90 shares to E, who shorts them all to F. Now A owns 90, B 10, D 90 and F 90, for a total of 280 shares. Short interest is 180 shares out of 100 outstanding. No problem! No big deal! You can just keep re-borrowing the shares. F can lend them to G! It's fine.”",1612151658,glk5n5e,5,wallstreetbets

DAEread,"I worry that if the SEC did anything about this now, they would halt trading on gme to ""remove the illegal shares to protect the little guy"" and thereby stopping the real squeeze. We'd all be fucked, and then hedge funds would get a $1 fine and 10million bonuses for all and buy new hampton vacation homes on their own illegal activity.

Now I hope I'm very wrong but I'm just trying to make a point. Enforcement of anything *too soon* could hypothetically stop tendies day from happening.

Not doing it right away though, gonna make one more play: selling 2x20p’s and 1x40p for APR GME. If only the 40 exercises I get 100 shares at ~$15/share (after premiums). If both exercise, I get 300 shares at ~$18/share after premiums. Iron is too hot to walk away from a theta gang (and Vega in this case) play imo. 2.5k premiums off 8k collateral. Ends up just north of 30% return if GME stays above 40.

Usual-Championship88,"I wrote this a couple days ago but feel like people should still read this if they haven’t and are in on AMC - everyone needs to do their part on social media!!!!! 

AMC - it is a company that has been around since 1920, survive the Great Depression, WW2 &amp; The 08 recession .. with the vaccines rolling out in the hundreds of millions, our economy is going to start to re open and people are going to want to go to the movies (cabin fever anyone?). Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when it’s low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Don’t panic, never sell low! I know you’ve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we aren’t selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media it’s Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the 🚀 to the 🌝 !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! don’t get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they can’t do something ie. “You can’t buy but you can sell” (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more. DONT BE AFRAID, we are in this war together. We may not win every battle, but we WILL win the war ! Too much publicity not to at this point.

MindofLogic23,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, you'll be taxed on realized gains once you sell the stock. Weigh your risk tolerance on if you want to transfer the stocks or liquidate. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert. 

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

mrtimtam72,"**Listen here you absolute fucking monkeys**

SLV is shit because you don’t own it and it uses leased silver anyway. Buy Physical. after GME.

Have a read of the rest of my comment and take a look at some of the stuff I’ve linked. To be clear I’m not saying sell GME and go to silver, I’m saying once you’ve stuck it to the man for GME, let’s really stick it to all the banks that rely of this metals manipulation so that they can keep a fiat currency going and enjoy being the recipients of bailouts while you and your children inherit the invisible tax of inflation.

There may be some bots but I can assure you there is legitimacy to this argument.

**This is no trap, It is simply people who have been following the silver short for literal years and have become encouraged by the recent happenings in the market.**

The truth is, sure you’re sticking it to the man but other hedge funds are also making money - which I find no issue with but fundamentally you have not changed the system which allows this to happen. If you truely want to stick it to the man I urge you to do some research on silver whilst you enjoy holding GME as many of us are.

Some details here;

Silvers use is largely inelastic, whether it cost $20oz or $100oz apple will still buy it to make iPhones, Samsung will still buy it to make their phones, white goods companies will still purchase it to make their appliances. Those pushing for the green deals will not care about the price, they will just continue printing to fund their deals and this just plays into the cantillon effect.

The addition of investor demand will be too much for the fragile system. A system where silver is primarily produced as a byproduct/pollutant in the mining of other metals.

If silver goes up, it will take gold up with it, but it must be through silver because, as stated it is inelastic and almost 100% of production is used every year and in some cases such as this year more than 100%. With gold, the central banks can easily flood the market and we will quickly run out of cash with which to buy the gold that comes out of cold storage.

Silver is the Achilles heel of the financial system, as silver goes up - gold must follow; if gold follows then confidence in the dollar is lost since gold is generally a fear trade (let’s not forget bonds have a negative real yield). If confidence in the dollar is lost, central banks must revert to honest money. The most likely and least disruptive way this would occur is by a revaluation of the price of gold and silver relative to the amount of fiat dollars that exist. The banks have been buying gold for years in anticipation of such an event. They are well aware of what they’re doing.

You can find a pretty comprehensive report on silver in the In Gold We Trust Report on and after page 249;

So I told her it was going through the roof right now and as I'm telling her what's going on she pulls out her phone and gets onto robinhood for the first time in a while and is like wtffff. I guess she had ZERO clue what was going on with gamestop and totally forgot she had some.

YggdrasilBurnes,"Hedge funds are investment funds used by many multiple traders. Melvin, Citron, even Citadel are basically just giant pots of liquid and semi-liquid assets that their traders draw from for their Investments. There is no one party when it comes to stocks. Outside of clearing houses paying out brokers and brokers paying out traders, everything else is just collaborative funding efforts to keep money flowing between hands.

As for the short share being sold back to Person A, that share IS person A's. It can't be sold back because it wasn't sold to person B, it was loaned. That share is Person A's. 

Imagine if I tried to sell you your own car after you let a friend borrow it, and your friend let me borrow it. You never sold your car. It's yours. It's just not in your hands. In third person, Person A would have every right to recall their share at that point and force persons C and B to trade back, at profit or loss.

The issue here for them now is that neither person C or B have the Car now. Person D, the retail investors, IE, Us, have the Car. Because Person A never actually had the car. Because person A's car was an OVERshorted stock that doesn't exist in the market. And Person A wants his non-existent car back at all costs.",1612151796,glk5wo7,2,wallstreetbets

World: Tesla?

WSB: All futures are red going into Monday

World: You sure you up to this particular call?

World: Yeah, But this hedge fund, has pockets deeper than we can imagine.

WSB: Yes, well, he's never held against me.

World: Yes, he has.

WSB: He's never held against me twice, and we're getting all those options excericed in the morning

World: well, they better let everybody buy those shares.

WSB: You know, I'm 1500 dollars in. I've lost  twice as much as that. And every one of those dollars could've gone towards my rent.  I'm only holding because fate wants me alive. Citadel  is just the latest of a long line of bastards, and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance - fate wills it so.

I cannot imagine putting in my entire life’s savings, retirement, or borrowed money into this.

For the Robinhood fiasco, note you can still use their apps and tools, or use thinkorswim.  It should all be free.  Then do the actual trade on Fidelity and Vanguard.

And yeah, once this squeeze is over, leave a review for Robinhood and explain why you’re removing your money.  Then remember their inevitable IPO and remind family and friends why they can’t be trusted.  They have an incestuous relationship with the shorts and high frequency traders.  They are out to allegedly sell your private info and trades and betray you at the first opportunity.

grassfeeding,"I have a couple thoughts on that. First, they are big in the feed ingredient market (remember that movie The Informant about fixing the lysine markets, great film if you haven't seen it). I wouldn't be surprised if they plan to produce a line of feed or feed ingredients to sell to feed companies and co-ops that they can market as sustainable/lower emissions, etc. Think backyard chickens, homesteaders, very small farms, people who buy a few 50lb bags a week instead of a few truck loads. That may be a way to avoid the economic issues of production via a marketing premium. Somewhat limited market, but a good market and they know feed ingredients. 

This could maybe supplant the use of fish meal in non-soy organic feeds, although I'll have to look into the amino acid profile. Methionine is typically lacking in feeds that don't include some soy for hogs and chickens. You get around this with things like field peas, fish meal, alfalfa meal, sunflower meal, peanut meal, etc. Fish meal is expensive and not sustainable. In the organic world you can't use synthetic MET.

The other side may be the PR angle, some big companies are looking into regenerative Ag stuff (General Mills a good example). 

Ag expects significant shifts in regs and/or incentives for environmental changes in the coming years. These will be targeted at livestock and crop production. A desire to make production more efficient and lower GHG emissions. There are a number of startups in this space looking at the potential for new carbon markets. This could be something there as well. Perhaps the tech can be used with crop residues or some in-house byproducts as well, that would be something.

I'll do some digging on it tho.",1612151855,glk60re,8,wallstreetbets

800oz_gorilla,"Basically if you are holding a call option that expires in the money, your broker will exercise it, meaning your account buys the stocks whatever the strike price is, in 100 increments based on how.many calls you had.

10 contracts of strike price 200? Your account just bought 1000 shares of GME for 200 dollars a piece. Your account just spent $200,000 that you may not have. Then your broker buys it on margin, and will likely give you notice to fund your account or they will start liquidating your positions.

This could theoretically cause a flash crash, but I don't know if there are details that change how the stock is sold. But if it crashes from 320 to 120, you were just forced to sell a bunch of shares at an 80 dollar loss. And your breakeven price might have been at 150 a share. So you actually screwed yourself.

sevaiper,"Basically, every time anyone is lent a share it ""counts"" in the numerator of stocks lent short. That person, who is only borrowing the share, is free to lend it to someone else, making that stock count again in the calculation of stocks lent short but not making any economic difference in the total short obligation. A high short interest indicates that the people who are shorting the stock have been actively trading their short obligation, not that there are that many people who currently hold a short interest. 

I feel like that may be even less clear I'm sorry, but the main take away is a high short interest does not mean everyone who has ""short interest"" according to S3 or Bloomberg or whatever is going to be obligated to buy the stock if it gets squeezed. The ""true"" short interest is certainly high for GME, but it is not anywhere near 140%.",1612151892,glk638p,5,wallstreetbets

Lifeception,"On Friday, after not getting any updates/change in shares available to short from iborrowdesk and fintel, fintel put up a message that they had not been getting updates for some time to the number of shares available to short....

Oretx also implied they had to cover Friday unless I misread the days to cover thing (i also don't understand how a fraction of a day works on DTC but hey)

The actual information on short interest has been manipulated since Thursday by my estimate (if not earlier) from my watching the numbers across these three sources.
All we have are estimates until Feb 9 then we see where it was on Friday for real, don't forget the two-three week gap in official records as they are recorded bi-monthly and released over a week later from each date of record.

I trust S3, more then some free data on the interwebs, S3 is a decent group with folks who enjoy being entertained, they really have no reason to have posted any news for us. Yes I know you will say ""but they posted news to manipulate the people"" but I highly doubt that.

I really think there is a fix in, MM already proved they are not below blatant and possibly illegal moves against GME stock (i don't know the exact laws but certainly seems what they have tried counts as illegal manipulation to me).

Remember, they had a whole weekend to strategize and have access to more resources, brain power, capital, and information then any of us. They are not above cheating. They will pay the fine when they get caught and they will be so grateful to do so vs take the losses.


I'm long with 10 shares at 17.50$ but the fix seems in, they aren't going to play fair.

Don't forget what institutions hold and how many shares they hold each...read the link below, whose to say BOA doesn't just dump a bunch of share or anyone else on the list to grab profits and help free up the hedge funds. BOA says 10$ tops for GME so this would be an ideal time for them to dump it all and make themselves a fortune.

Holdings by institution, a couple links to peruse...
https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings
https://fintel.io/so/us/gme

Not a gay bear, just been trying to get to the heart of the matter of whats going on and could happen next and there are a lot of things in play we don't know or that could work against GME which I have not seen addressed anywhere.

Also looks like someone else tried to post about fintel not being able to update GME short interest but it was removed....wonder why....https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/l7fxrs/fintel_not_updating_short_volume_ratio_for_gme/

All said and done, this is not advice, I am not a financial advisor, do whatever the hell you want, I don't care. Maybe these 10 shares can hit 1k plus and I can get some car parts (feed my real addiction).

I probably won't reply to anyone who comments on this, just a lazy asshole who mostly lurks and doesn't have a fuck to give. But feel free to keep the conversation going without me.",1612151922,glk658l,-8,wallstreetbets

rightovahere,"Thursday is exactly why I feel people are going to be holding an enormous -75% bag before they know it. 

GME is already so volatile it regularly bounces back from 15-20% drops; holders are just conditioned to hold through them at this point, with the expectation it'll bounce back. 

Except at some point it'll drop another 20%, where the inexperienced might convince themselves this is just a larger dip. Then it drops another 20%, and the sunken cost starts kicking in and they baghold down to 85% losses. There's a reason experienced traders so heavily re-iterate having quantifiable exit plans, both positive and negative, before you trade.

For full disclosure, I've scaled out of a significant % of my original GME gains.",1612151935,glk663c,8,wallstreetbets

Honsoku,"I don't think your failure-to-deliver amounts are a reliable reflection of the situation. The counts on any given settlement date are the cumulative outstanding fails from 09/2008 and it looks like you just grabbed the date with the largest amount in the dataset (12/03/20). Average fails less starting fails would likely be a better measure (really avg fails/avg volume). However, even looking at just average outstanding fails, GME sits at spot 95 out of 12K firms (AMC is at 41).

BubblegumHummingbird,"Don't panic

I use Schwab too

The only issue I had, as well as others, was getting an error message of, "" this ticker isn't valid"". And we couldn't execute buy or sell orders easily. HOWEVER, it did end up working that same day. You just had to keep refreshing.

Now, that did affect my trust personally. BUT, it really did seem to be a high traffic volume related error. You have to keep in mind that many brokerages had a HUGE explosion of people trying to execute orders at the same time. It's been an abnormal amount of traffic.

MANY brokerages experienced glitches and issues.

Schwab is their own clearing house. That's good. And no, Schwab has never put a restriction on me being able to buy or sell GME or any other ticker.

aaaaaaaarrrrrgh,"&gt;Apparently modernizing the app would take a decent amount of time.

I have *some* idea about app development, and it really shouldn't be that hard to get a very basic version out quickly (days, plus review time) if they treat it as an emergency and they have capable devs (and an API).

It won't be fancy, but it should be able to show your portfolio and let you buy and sell stocks.

No charts. No options trading. No deposit/withdrawal from the app. Not many settings. English only. Poor accessibility. But working for the basic functions.

The apps are successful *because* they're simple. Build the basics, fix it later.",1612152052,glk6e0t,1,wallstreetbets

csthrowie,"Context: a ""[beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beard_(companion))"" can be a slang term meaning: a spouse/gf/bf/significant other that you use as a diversion/cover to conceal the fact that you are gay. It gives the appearance that you are in a heterosexual relationship when really, you are flaming hotter than Citron's cash reserves. The person who is serving as the role of the beard may be aware of this and in on the whole operation, or an unwitting person who is unaware they are just gay camouflage.

OP is implying that your wife is just a way to hide that you're gayer than all the hedge fund market manipulation of the past week. ... or maybe your wife is the beard for your wife's boyfriend. Or maybe your wife is pulling double duty beard'ing for both of you so you and your wife's boyfriend can have steamy homosexual playtime inbetween stock market trading.

How does the broker clear ownership to A and B when there are no longer short sellers? See shorting shares increases supply virtually, but when all we have are holders, who picks up the short position?

FredDidnah,"It looks like RH will still be restricting GME tomorrow per their update today.

That being said, and I said this earlier to someone else so I will paste it instead of repeating,

While I’m not saying there wasn’t collusion behind closed doors, I do believe the limiting of shares was largely a liquidity problem caused by them needing 100% collateral due to high volatility (instead of the normal 2 or 3% of whatever it is) and simply not having enough money to do that. Hence the 1 billion RH needed last week. Obviously still not an acceptable reason.",1612152088,glk6ghp,1,wallstreetbets

BubblegumHummingbird,"Regarding SCHWAB

The only issue I had, as well as others, was getting an error message of, "" this ticker isn't valid"". And we couldn't execute buy or sell orders EASILY. HOWEVER, it did end up working that same day. You just had to keep refreshing.

Now, that did affect my trust personally. BUT, it really did seem to be a high traffic volume related error. You have to keep in mind that many brokerages had a HUGE explosion of people trying to execute orders at the same time. It's been an abnormal amount of traffic.

MANY brokerages experienced glitches and issues.

Schwab is their own clearing house. That's good. And no, Schwab has never put a restriction on me being able to buy or sell GME or any other ticker.

Honestly, it's starting to get upsetting that people are implying Fidelity and Vanguard are the **only** brokerages you can trust.....

There's SO many people moving to Fidelity, that it's actually made me feel like it's making Fidelity a bigger target....",1612152092,glk6grk,10,wallstreetbets

(The accounts balance because C owes 90 shares to A, giving C, in a sense, negative 90 shares.) Short interest is 90 shares out of 100 outstanding. Now D lends her 90 shares to E, who shorts them all to F. Now A owns 90, B 10, D 90 and F 90, for a total of 280 shares. Short interest is 180 shares out of 100 outstanding. No problem! No big deal! You can just keep re-borrowing the shares. F can lend them to G! It's fine.”

ZX9010,"Majority of people are going to be selling when it hits 1k im sure. Judging by most people's posts/replies, most people only care about the gains, screwing over the hedgies is just a plus for them.

For me? I have about about 10k tied up in this all just because i hate hedgies. Im probably not going to pull out until unless the squeeze is over and the hedgies get fucked. I dont really care about loss, so i'll just recoup whatever is left over.

_greyknight_,"32 here as well. Just started investing in May last year as a total noob, and before this GME bonanza started I had managed to put together a well diversified portfolio of 15 stocks and around $7k that was giving me a 25% return in this short period. And these weren't volatile or risky picks either. You'll get there in no time, just read and watch. I can recommend The Motley Fool podcasts as a good starting point for value investing, investopedia for general definitions, and then when you get a little more into it, professor Aswath Damodaran on YouTube, he's an expert in estimating company valuations.

 The best thing about starting to invest was how much more mindful it made me about where I put my money and how I spend it. When you have the option of a 20%+ ROI, you really start to see the opportunity cost of spending it on bullshit instead.",1612152141,glk6k42,15,wallstreetbets

polishrocket,"Your are correct that you will be taxed in your tax bracket but your earnings could push you to a next bracket so double check your bracket after earnings.  The big issue I see is people forget about state taxes, please don’t forget!  Fill out your estimated tax payments for federal and state to be safe and pay after quarter one which is due April 15th if you had mad Gaines.  

You can net out your stock losses vs stock gains.  For example, and I’m calling myself out here.  I gained 2k in short term investments but I lost 2k in options so I can net that to zero gain for the year.  I was trying to learn options and didn’t do well.  Life lessons.

You shouldn’t have any additional taxes or penalties.  You can’t write off travel against an investment income u less the travels directly relates to the investment which I kind of doubt.",1612152151,glk6ksa,3,wallstreetbets

otakucode,"I've gotten tired of it, so now when I recognize something, I move on it.  My most recent is still playing out, but doing well.  Everyone was all excited for AMD to come out with Ryzen chips.  They announced earnings, and they were bad.  Then literally the next day, AMD announced the details of the Ryzen chips and blew everybodys mind.  Wall Street bros were just looking at the bad earnings, so the stock was low.  Not as bad as I'd seen it in the past, but it was at like $40 which was even down around that time (think this was 18 months ago?  2 years?  Something like that.).  It seemed obvious to me their sales and earnings were down because everybody was holding out for Ryzen.  I knew I was, and I knew lots in the tech space were, so they'd sell like hotcakes.  So I bought as much as I could.  Since then, it's been up 175%+ at times.  It's down to $85 right now despite them reporting beating all earnings and sales predictions by fair margin while it had been pushing close to $100, I presume because some people think the new Intel CEO will be able to turn that bureaucratic behemoth on a dime.  They're wrong, so I'm debating going in even further, but not until GME and AMC get their due ;)",1612152154,glk6l0y,2,wallstreetbets

WSB: Well, I've traded with them before, but this time, it might truly be a big win for us

WSB: Both Distractions form the game squeeze

World: But still got BB though?

WSB: Be killed through ladders by a dark Hedge Fund

World: Tesla?

WSB: All futures are red going into Monday

World: You sure you up to this particular call?

WSB: Absolutely, rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret are all tremendous motivators, they really clear the mind so I'm really good to go.

World: Yeah, But this hedge fund, has pockets deeper than we can imagine.

WSB: Yes, well, he's never held against me.

World: Yes, he has.

WSB: He's never held against me twice, and we're getting all those options excericed in the morning

World: well, they better let everybody buy those shares.

WSB: You know, I'm 1500 dollars in. I've lost  twice as much as that. And every one of those dollars could've gone towards my rent.  I'm only holding because fate wants me alive. Citadel  is just the latest of a long line of bastards, and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance - fate wills it so.

World: Mm-hmm. And what if you're wrong?

**WSB::** Well, if I'm wrong, then... what more could I lose?

Lothspell,"both, but you won't be able to find physical. JP Morgan and the COMEX exist to manipulate the price of silver down. Anytime the price starts to rise, JPM creates a bunch of new fake ""supply"" by creating new derivatives, but the actual supply of silver doesn't go up. Just the fake contracts. Right now, silver is rehypothecated by 200 - 500x what the actual supply is. It will be a game of musical chairs as to who gets to settle in actual silver. The rest will get burned, but it will take down JPM with it, and the rest of the global financial system. Pensions, gone. Savings, gone. Insurance, mortgages...everything will be affected. You'll have 100 years of gains reversed in mere weeks, from the ultra rich, to those holding physical silver. This will usher in a cyberpunk technological dark age, but it was always going to happen.

hardwaresofton,"Yeah, that's the idea -- think of TF2 with hats, CS:GO with skins. Creating marketplaces with custom digital trinkets is the way to go for reliably growing revenue from a thing like reddit, or at least it's one of the really sustainable ways. If you see ""reddit loot boxes"" then you should think back to this, because that will be the biggest confirmation I could imagine (also, making a way to effectively do reddit loot boxes actually might be a great short term business idea).

You can't always create more placements for ads (especially if you think about backlash), but you can *definitely* always create more (and more of) a bunch of digital trinkets like reddit gold.

It's a brilliant move on their part, it's a great revenue stream. Imagine getting this revenue stream so fat that you could afford to actually raise prices on ads or go ad-free all together (that will likely never happen but I can dream).",1612152290,glk6u1p,2,wallstreetbets

Lost_Schedule_8298,"The US government loves short sellers, because they help them build racist Empire.  Don’t believe me?

&gt; The Quantum Fund’s bet against the Bank of England in 1992 is probably the fund’s most famous trade. But this only one trade in the story and the Quantum Fund recorded many other successful trades over its life. One of the more controversial trades (or group of trades) put on by the fund was against a basket of Asian currencies, specifically the currencies of Thailand and Malaysia just before 1997 to 1998 Asian Financial Crisis.

&gt; According to sources who had knowledge of the Quantum Fund’s positioning at the time, Soros bet just under $1 billion of his total war chest of $12 billion against the baht. There’s plenty of speculation that because he placed such a large bet on baht, Soros helped engineer the Asian crisis via his political connections. 

&gt; The bank eventually broke, the baht devalued and Soros profited. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/how-george-soros-broke-the-bank-of-thailand-2016-9

The end result?  The American IMF swooped in during the ensuing crisis, and devastated all Asian countries, including my own, South Korea:

&gt; It is now widely recognized that the International Monetary Fund has actually worsened the Asian economic crisis; in fact it is difficult to find an economist outside the government or the IMF payroll who will defend its recent actions. As the misery and frustration spread throughout the area, expressions like “IMF riots,” “IMF survival crimes” and “IMF suicides” have become a part of the regional vocabulary.

They may slap some extra delay on top out of malice of course, but they're done. They probably cost themselves at least 50% of their user base, and 75% of their IPO value, and that's if they don't go bankrupt.",1612152353,glk6y8f,1,wallstreetbets

insanity2brilliance,"And not to support his feedback, as I disagree that he thinks it’s delusional. Will it hit $400 in a few days? Maybe, maybe not. 

However, AMC is THE secondary play right now. GME is the sultan of stocks right now. GME will play its course. Eventually the squeeze will happen and people will cash out. And I’m 100% not saying that AMC has the same lucrative chances that GME does. It won’t. It will never have the potential, in today’s market, to hit 10k. That would truly be delusional. 

That being said, there is market there based on its short percentage. It will never be GME. Ever. However, GME profits will go somewhere. I’m just a retard and I’m just going to keep pouring money into AMC. And not just because people who made bank in GME will dump money into it. And not because people who are excited about AMC will buy boatloads more of stock this week. 

I’m dumping money in to AMC because they just eliminated $600 Mil in debt and I really love the stock. Not just now if it hits records share prices. But I genuinely love the stock long term when everything opens back up. 

So when someone says $1K per share is delusional, what else can you expect from a retard like me that said GME could never do anything 6 months ago. 

I just like the AMC stock and I’m a retard. If it hits $1k a share, woo hoo, I’ll buy an extra bunch of bananas from my local grocer. If it doesn’t, woo hoo, I’ll realize the long term investment post Covid.

mrtimtam72,"Lmao you smooth brain. No one is saying sell GME, simply do your due diligence on yet another big short whilst you hold GME. 

GME is not the only short, it is merely just the beginning. Look at my post history, am I a fucking hedgie?
And actually read my post. 

Sounds like you’re the fucking trap, not allowing another idea to be floated.

To be clear what I’m saying is **HOLD** GME to your hearts content, once you sell and make money move onto the next short, GME is not the only overly shorted thing which exists in this world.

Alevin326,"HFs have incentive to publicize this information. They sell a stock short, flooding the market with shares, which drives the price down. Then they announce that they sold short, which drives the stock down further as other investors trust that these MFs have the sole intention of driving a valid business into the ground for their own gain (“oh no we must protect the retail investors from themselves before insiders fuck it up anyway”)

Will be interesting to see how they operate moving forward

followupquestion,"I think it’s the other way around. All counterfeit shares are about to be discovered and the people who sold them will need to get real ones per market rules. That’s a squeeze, but on a level heretofore unseen. Imagine owing 30 million shares and knowing you’ll have to make sure they’re legit, because the people who bought them aren’t planning to take the cash. If it’s true, they’re going to be practically killing each other to get out. The hedge funds are backstopped by Citadel and Apex, which are backed up by the banks, which are too big to fail. Tens of millions of shares may need to be bought in addition to the short squeeze we already knew about, plus I’m pretty sure the 10+ million shares needed to fulfill all the calls that finished ITM on Friday.

My understanding of the contracts for the market mean they have to fulfill those shares, and honestly this has the potential to drag down the whole market so the Federal government might step in and just cash out every legit share for thousands of dollars to keep everything moving. It’s not like the Fed can’t just print the cash, so the 2021 bailout could literally mean buying every GME share for a massive price to keep the banks solvent. If they made the number $10k per share I’d be sad I don’t get $69,420 per share but I’d get over it more than if the cheaters somehow win. 

Then again, I’m a dumb monkey or ape, and definitely not a financial advisor.",1612152583,glk7d9r,18,wallstreetbets

General_Kerberos,"I mean, the ""**a bunch of hypocrites""**

Applies to all of us making money off of this, including those that have made millions from this.

We shit on the 1%, but we have people here that are going to be going into the top 20% and 10% because of all of this, and I am sure as shit they are not going to be giving money to the less fortunate of us who are struggling to make ends meet and pay for medical care, and those of us who probably have and are going to loose all of it.

What's new really, money corrupts at the end of the day so.

I would change my mind on it if when this is all over, those of us who did not make if big, if the big winners of this set up a charity line to help those of us, that would be something worthy of shitting on the 1% because we would actually be taking care of our own.

Otherwise, by definition, no matter if we are doing this to ""stick it to the 1%"" they would be no different than them.

If I make enough that I can cover my childs treatment, you bet your autistic ass I will be helping people out.

ShawkzInvest,"Yep, keep in mind that GME and BB is completely different play. 

GME is a mixture of Gamma Squeeze and Short Squeeze at terminal level.

Where as BB is gamma squeeze with healthy growth. This is a very healthy investment because BB is focusing on Cybersecurity sector than actually mobile phone.

Overall the reason why shorter don't really shorts BB is because the risk for them is too high because BB is a legitimate company. At least compared to GME. But hey, I like GME :)

SportTheFoole,"I believe it is entirely possible to get margin called for exercising an option. Consider:

You have a $300c expiring Friday with $36,000 in cash in the account +100k margin. You do nothing, the call expires in the money and you take no action to *not* exercise after hours (you have time to decide after hours wherever you want to exercise, but by default it’ll exercise if ITM). The shares get delivered to your account Saturday. You also decide Saturday that you need 7k, so you withdraw that from your account. 

Now Monday comes around and the broker uses 29k cash + 1k in margin to fulfill your obligation for the contract. Furthermore, since the stock is volatile, your broker has a 100% margin requirement.

So now you have 100 shares, 1k of which is from margin. You’re going to get margin called (probably not terrible if you have another 1k you can find, but if your broker is nice they’ll give you till the end of day to settle up before liquidating your positions as they see fit).",1612152684,glk7jrr,1,wallstreetbets

Millenial_Subutai,"&gt;even if I lose my 2 cents in it

See thats where your mindset is to cut your nose in spite of your face. 

The financial system is coming down. I've been expecting this implosion for over 10 years. I am actually surprised it took this long and I never would have thought it would be this sub that would not only pop their bubble, but stick it to them in the process. 

With that said, I want nothing more than this financial system nuked because of the stagnation and damage fractional reserve banking has done to us... However... the problem with many people, especially Millenials who are justifiably angry, is that they don't understand the system and therefore emotionally lash out and demand things that will ultimately bite them in the ass.

The problem with laws and regulations is that they are written specifically for those with the know-how to get around them. And because of the niavete of most people, they get their demanded regs... and the problems persists. The issue is dealing with the problem at the root and not the problems that grow out of the cause. And the root of the problem is fiat currency where purchasing power is destroyed as more debt is taken out. This cycle of debt spending and rigged markets allows for the game to continue. All regs and taxes will do is cut you out of the market while the big players get around it.",1612152745,glk7npj,3,wallstreetbets

I look for a explosion of new movies in the next 1-3 years and studios will want to make all the money they’ve been missing out on this year back and the fastest way to profits for them is theatrical releases. They can make back the costs of making a movie back in 1 weekend with theatrical releases.

KennyG-Man,"I saw that years ago and it has jaded me ever since.  The truth is there is often no truth on financial TV.  Like I have said many times, the Main Street media is Wall Street’s propaganda arm.  

Now, should we shame Jim for telling us about these tricks, no.  Maybe he was actually trying to atone for that behavior by doing his TV show. I like to think so.  I’m sure he doesn’t have the inside read anymore, and he doesn’t have the rapacious desire for jacking his P&amp;L like the old days. Just instinct.  

All of these jokers, I listen to for the words, but not the truth.  

If anybody is actually reading this my suggestion for an endgame is to either
1) stay on their necks for a year.  Sell only after you have a lower capital gains rate... that’s a full year of holding.  This is for you people that want to “stick it to them good”.  You have no interest in making money, just teaching them a lesson.  You recognize this might be a donation, not an investment.  GME will surely have a secondary offering by then.  Maybe they figure out a new strategy.  GME is analogous to what Netflix would have been if they never got into streaming and their own content.
2) take out your cost basis such that you have broken even (achieved invulnerability), and hold the rest for a year.  This is for the more practical of you.
3) pay off whatever bills you really have to pay/want to pay to get yourself closer to financial freedom, then sit on the rest for a year.  
4) watch the actual short interest numbers and don’t sell anything until they drop to at least 50%.  Definitely don’t listen to all this chatter in the media about funds covering.  It’s still over-shorted, the initial buy thesis holds.

I think all these choices should be acceptable to choose from.  Unless you want to subsidize GME indefinitely (sounds crazy, but might happen), or they re-invent the company, it will come down eventually and someone will be there to take advantage of it.  I say all these things because I do want to see the little guy win in aggregate. 

Full disclosure, I am not long or short GME.",1612152848,glk7uez,1,wallstreetbets

Optimal_Challenge_92,The popular narrative right now is that the autists here are what's causing this squeeze. We've been helping for sure but if retail traders never came into the picture this would still be happening. There's others that noticed the short interest early on I am sure. Do you think if retail never entered the trade that we'd be hearing this doom and gloom about how the gamestop squeeze will cause a financial crisis?

inkstee,"hijacking top comment for exposure: EVERYBODY NEEDS TO LOOK INTO **CONDITIONAL TRAILING STOP LIMITS.**

This is a sophisticated conditional order that will help you to lock in profits as the ceilings move. Here is what all those fucking words mean:

**CONDITIONAL** means that the order won't submit until a certain condition is met (i.e. submit this order if price&gt;$1000).

**TRAILING STOP $/%** is a kind of order that follows the stock price up as it increases, always staying a certain percentage or $ amount below it. If the stock starts to come down, it holds the line. If the stock trips the line, it triggers a sell.

**LIMIT** some brokers only allow you to trigger a market order off a trailing stop, which is fucking idiotic. Others allow you to trigger a limit order that is a $/% of whatever last transaction tripped your stop, which is brilliant.

**ALL TOGETHER**: a CONDITIONAL TRAILING STOP LIMIT plays out like this...

&gt;(1) The condition you set becomes true  
&gt;  
&gt;(2) A trailing stop order is automatically submitted that trails after the price as it rises, staying behind the price by whatever $ amount or % you set.  
&gt;  
&gt;(3) When the price reaches its high and starts to go down, your trail stop stays put and is eventually tripped.  
&gt;  
&gt;(4) This triggers a limit order. You preset the limit order to be a specific $ amount or % above/below the transaction that tripped your trail stop.

An example of one that I set:

&gt;(1) price goes above $1000  
&gt;  
&gt;(2) this triggers a trail stop that follows the price up, but stays 20% behind it to make room for dramatic swings.  
&gt;  
&gt;(3) Let's say the price hits $1000  briefly and then plummets straight down to trip the stop at $800.  
&gt;  
&gt;(4) The stop getting tripped triggers a limit order I preset to sell some shares (not all) that is priced 1% below the trip price, which is $790.

I've set a few of these whose conditions are met at $1000, $2500, and $5000. If this shit rockets, which it will, the idea is that all of these trailing stops will follow it up as it moves up and hopefully won't get triggered until the price has hit $690,420 and started to come back down.",1612153042,glk86vi,1,wallstreetbets
werkqwerk,"I want to hijack your comment to ask a really dumb question.

What is the risk here to the amateur investor? Why do so many “experts” say that the little guy is going to get hurt? If you’re watching the market - or even better, have sell orders in place - what’s stopping people from selling their position when the price drops below their loss threshold?

I understand that there’s more advanced trading tactics like buying on the margins, shorts, and options that can obligate you and expose you to greater amounts of risk.

But for the average person who thinks they might have a winner, what is the downside to putting some money on a stock and hoping for the best, and pulling it if it doesn’t go up? Do things move so quickly that brokers don’t make the trade soon enough? Or is it psychologically so diffcult for people to know when enough is enough?

Honestly asking here, not trying to meme or troll. I, like a lot of people, am just getting into this and I want to know what trips people up.",1612153042,glk86vw,68,wallstreetbets

Grandpa_Smoothie,"You can call the broker. Or you can file a form 8949 with your taxes to tell the IRS what you think the correct basis is. Or you can pay someone to prepare your taxes that year, and they can take the records from your old and new broker and prepare forms for you. 

In other words, you have avenues to get your legally proper basis even if a broker screws it up.

(My hobby is reading IRS forms and pubs. And I have had to file nasty long form 8949 after cashing out NSO's, for some reason employers systematically report the wrong basis on those.)",1612153068,glk88k8,3,wallstreetbets

BlenderdickCockletit,"Where the fuck are you seeing that they lose 30% per day on GME interest?

If you're talking about the interest rate for the shares they borrowed, that percentage is annualized. For retards who don't know what annualized means it means it's 30% divided by 365. Also their borrow rate can change day-to-day depending on the demand for the stock. **If they borrowed 100,000 shares and it closes at $300.00 and they don't sell the shares that means they have to pay $30,000,000/365 at the end of the day which makes it $82,191.78 for that single day.** This is a very affordable maintenance program for such a huge hedge fund.

I'm not entirely sure where people are getting figured that Citadel is losing billions per day because they haven't lost anything until they actually close out their positions and they can probably afford to maintain these positions for months if they have to. 

Furthermore, Citadel holds roughly 1.4 Billion in various SLV positions. **PSLV is no better than SLV** because they're both backed by physical silver and you can *technically* request delivery of silver through those vehicles except they both require you to be an ""approved"" trader, SLV requires that you call at least 50,000 shares and PSLV requires that you call at least 10,000 troy oz which currently is about 25,000 shares. You aren't ""squeezing"" silver. Not now, not ever.

otakucode,"No real idea, I have had retirement accounts in Fidelity in the past, but I never mess with those.  Just let those things sit in boring big funds and such.  For stocks, I have used TDA for years, but have never been terribly active, I normally have 2 or 3 stocks and hold them for months or years.  Like I have no taxable events for last year from TDA as I only bought shares, never sold anything.  I was built for this GME shit, and when I bought AMC I fully expected I might need to hold that for a year to see what happens when pandy passes.

TDA does annoy me that I don't seem to be able to put in a limit sell order for like $5k/sh.  Says its too far higher than prior trades.  There might be a way to force it (the message is phrased like this limit is to prevent you making mistakes) but I haven't figured it out yet if so.  Not sure if Fidelity does that or not.

gateboy6,"Okay, I've been wanting to say something and I guess this is as good an opportunity as any.  
I get this instance is almost certainly just a dumb spam scam, but..

A lot of people are talking about this being a huge wealth redistribution.. that's great. But there's a big flaw.. you need to but shares in the first place.  
There's people here who are easily buying hundreds, thousands, even more, shares. These people aren't exactly in poverty or lower class and they're gonna make millions *when* GME rockets.  
Then there's the people who really need the wealth redistribution who can barely afford a share or two.. or not even a single one. They'll make a lot less or none at all..  
I feel like if we tried, we could organize some kind of share donation/semi-equalization event/system/thing. People with tons of shares sharing a few to people who have barely any/none.  
Also, don't forget to donate to charities and give back. Especially those with mountains of shares about to make tons if money. We're better than them. We care.",1612153108,glk8b5e,3,wallstreetbets

IamUandwhatIseeisme,"I am not 100% on this but it's basically that you're using your money to make more money before it's available.

For instance this;

Cash available to trade = $0.00

* On Monday morning, you sell XYZ stock and nets $10,000 in cash account proceeds
* On Monday afternoon, he buys ABC stock for $10,000

If you sell ABC stock prior to Wednesday (the settlement date of the XYZ sale), the transaction would be deemed a good faith violation because ABC stock was sold before the account had sufficient funds to fully pay for the purchase.

This was stolen from the Fidelity FAQ. It means that you need the money to finish moving around before you use it (at least that's what I think it means... I am a fellow retard). When you are just starting, don't do it more than 5 times. After that, when you are established and know what's going on, don't do it anymore.",1612153195,glk8gvo,3,wallstreetbets

hardwaresofton,"Sounds like you have never heard about RISC-V -- it's not a serious threat to x86 and armv7 architectures yet but it's gaining momentum lately (some Chinese firms are very invested in it for reasons that should be obvious). In &lt;5 years it's probably going to be a real option/player. Have you priced in a third emerging architecture?

If I was you I might bet on a company like TSMC, which manufactures for anyone who needs it (and stays the fuck out of it, which is why people pick them). Their stock price (ADR) has 3xed since last year. The risks involved with TSMC are somewhat bigger though, but whatever is bad for TSMC is bad for the other companies that depend on it.

I'm not sure I buy your point about the new CEO not mattering -- I think the stock price reflects the optimism/relief felt by shareholders. I do agree, however, that $INTC and $AMD (and $NVDA) are relatively safe bets in this market. AMD and INTC's prodcuts are by and large substitutes so they can't *both* go to the moon in terms of marketshare. Revenues can rise as long as the market itself keeps growing though and they stay essentially stalemated.

lucioghosty,"Correct, you have to look at the volume traded per day. Currently it's at about 50M shares per day, but that's between EVERYBODY, and most of that is people BUYING shares, not selling them. And those that ARE selling them are the hedge funds shorting themselves even further to drive the price down, so it's an incredibly inaccurate representation.

If you look at the 90-day volume, it's closer to 10M shares traded/ per day, which means at a MINIMUM(50M shares traded per day) we're looking at 1.5 days and at MAXIMUM(10m shares per day) we're looking at 7.5 days until their short is filled. And that's just going off of the ~75M shares shorted. The more they short, the more they have to cover. You'll know when we're in the big squeeze, and you'll have ample time to wait them out.

#I INTEND TO HOLD FOR AS MUCH OF THE BIG SQUEEZE AS I CAN. THIS WILL KEEP THE PRICE AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

emeown,Totally understand I am doing the exact same thing. AMC came out of bankruptcy and that was huge and unlike GME they sold some shares to make sure they have money going ahead to stay afloat until they can open back up. This is also huge because it limits the risk. AMC stocks will be worth something in the long game which is what side we are on. Now me also being a low level function ape and not being able to do my numbers good sees that GME is shorted over 120% and that other monkeys have jumped all over that banana cart until the price of every share went to 380. working at Wendy's doesn't pay good so and I not smart enough to buy GME stock at 14 a share so instead I see other bannana cart with less bananas but still enough to fill my poor belly. I jump on that cart which has lots of potential. 1000 a share egh maybe overly optimistic maybe not hard for my primate brain to comprehend. If people buy and hold for the long haul so we can try to talk AMC into lowering the price of a box of milk duds from 10$ a box well then maybe. At some point they have to cover. I personally could care less if I ever sell these stocks because like you I like tje movies and I like these stocks and I like that they will pay millions until the cover there positions so who knows.

And now the most vulnerable are significant signing up and putting money on the line and you guys are encouraging it.

You are the hedge fund guys now.  You’re just as bad &amp; the press will ensure your painted that way.

Ah, you can only write off trading/investing losses if they exceed any trading/investing profits? Bummer, but good safety net I suppose.

And I meant I used to travel for work a lot, so between flights/hotels/rentals/gas/tolls/Ubers/etc., I was never in need of anything else to consider writing off; seems like I’d get as much as I was going to. Even managed enough work pre-pandemic in 2020 to have plenty to write off.

And since fiat currency will be useless, the value of gold and silver will shoot way up. From about $2000 per ounce (probably not accurate) to maybe $16000 an ounce (not accurate). There’s only so much gold and silver in the world.

Halfwegian,"I am glad I'm not alone in thinking this! If S3 and Ihor Dusaniwsky are to be believed, buying ITM calls to cover makes by far the most sense as to how one could cover shares short without a huge spike in volume and price on Friday. Buy calls, let them expire in the money, exercise, settlement, return the shares, and you're out of your position. What I don't know, and please by all means if you know, is whether settlement at expiration for a bunch of ITM calls can or does occur in the dark pool, and if so, when that happens. I mention this because if settlement can  occur on the dark pool, and the seller(s) of the calls had the shares or enough of them to close a major percentage of the ITM positions at end of day Friday, that could greatly reduce the  magnitude of any further squeeze. I'm not familiar with settlement terms at the institutional level: I don't know if at settlement it's all due at once, or if you can settle what you do have and then buy the shares you don't Monday morning. Again, if you know I'm all ears.",1612153340,glk8q6e,2,wallstreetbets

pingforhelp,"First you get hit with something called an exception where you try to explain it away. This may or may not work, depends on how good your compliance/supervision team are at bsing. For something of this scale, it likely will never work. Regardless, regulators will take your response and then review it.

If they find nothing wrong with it, they won't bring it up again, and it's locked away forever as regulators aren't allowed to review something twice - similar to the judicial system. If they do find something wrong with your response, you'll get something called an enforcement action which are usually 2 things:

1. a fine
2. proof that you have rules set in place to prevent this from happening again in the future

These fines are to scale with the violation+size of firm. It can be negotiated. FINRA and SEC both publicly disclose how much of their revenue is from fines so you can just google that. They are definitely in the business of fining (small firms at least)",1612153384,glk8t45,5,wallstreetbets

Puffin_fan,"My opinion of just this moment is that the private banks (JPM, BoM, BoC, TD, MS, C) are conning their retail customers into selling out of money calls and telling them it is a great deal and they will make easy money.

And doing this while Melvin and Point and Citadel and Griffin are covering and hedging.  

With the hope that when the retail call sellers get stung bad, the bad publicity will free them from accountability via PR strategies.

 But there has to be a breaking point, a line in the sand, for change to happen. People were angry in 2008, but they felt they had no power against the wealthy and hoped the government would take action. Now we've had a glimpse of power over the wealthy by trapping them in their rigged game, and if the government fails to take action again, the entire country goes to shit. 

That's what happens. The rich will escape using their mobility, then we try to build up from chaos and learn from our mistakes. Maybe it'll go differently, but I doubt it.",1612153416,glk8v12,3,wallstreetbets

Morgan settles lawsuit that accused firm of ‘spoofing’ precious metals markets trades](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html).   I have been following [https://www.silverdoctors.com/](https://www.silverdoctors.com/) for more than 10 years and also invested in Silver in the past.   Silver futures are just paper, thats why they can be manipulated and have been manipulated many times in the past especially by the large banks.

**But the interesting thing happening is that now people are starting to take physical delivery** and King world reports [“NO SILVER LIQUIDITY IN LONDON: This “Could Destabilize All Gold &amp; Silver Contracts” As Reddit Silver Short Squeeze Continues” – King World News #silver](https://thesilverindependent.com/2021/01/29/no-silver-liquidity-in-london-this-could-destabilize-all-gold-silver-contracts-as-reddit-silver-short-squeeze-continues-king-world-news-silver/).  Interestingly Silver doctors reported that there is no silver in New York also and many people are taking EFPS from new york for delivery in London.  So if there is no physical in London also, then Silver (PSLV) is headed like the Indian rocket PSLV, not just to the moon, but to Mars.

**DO NOT BUY SLV.  BY PSLV.**  [Read my post Buy PSLV it is backed by actual physical Silver. Dont buy SLV it is backed by JPM.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8iqqp/buy_pslv_it_is_backed_by_actual_physical_silver/)",1612153443,glk8wpv,0,wallstreetbets

lasagnahog1,"This all checks out. I think one important thing to add around the short interest is that the cost basis of the shorts matters

The first squeeze washed out all the low cost basis shorts (funds who sold GME down around the $5-20 area)

As these shorts washed out and the price skyrocketed, other shorts rushed in. This is one reason why short interest might not decrease all that much

However there is a HUGE difference between trying to squeeze a short $5GME position and trying to squeeze a short $350 position. The HFs short from $350 are going to hold as long as they have to since they will have 100% conviction in this trade",1612153443,glk8wqs,85,wallstreetbets

hyperian24,"This is precisely the case. For EVERY share sold short, there is a synthetic share created out of the ether.

So when you add up the holdings of the institutions, the index funds, the insiders, the billionaires, the autists, the whole freaking world that has now seen GME on the news.

The number of owned shares is WAAAYYYY beyond 100% of the true float.

But this is fantastic. Because as soon as a short seller buys a share to close a short position, that share just ceases to exist. So as they start to cover en masse, the people with 📃✋ will sell first, and then those shares are just gone. *Poof* they cannot be recirculated to close additional short positions, meaning that as they're are fewer short positions needing to be closed, there are also proportionately fewer shares owned, and a higher concentration of those shares will be owned by 💎✋.",1612153500,glk90h5,6,wallstreetbets

InvincibearREAL,"Sorry for your loss.

Here's a poem that I draw comfort from in times like these.

""I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter."" I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.""",1612153521,glk91rn,8,wallstreetbets

I'm not denying it's a good long play, the 3rd EDIT shows the reasons it might be.

No balls. 🚀🚀🚀,1612153588,glk9616,7,wallstreetbets

nthomas111,"You hold the shares but might not be able to cover the cost of the position. Say your Jan 29 300 call expires ITM with GME at 320. Say the contract when you opened it cost $1000 and you have $10k in your account and $10k of margin. Your ITM call gets auto exercised by your broker - this is very common and is generally in your favor. You just bought 100 shares of GME at $300/share totaling $30k for the sale. You now hold the shares but your combined capital and margin is not enough to cover the cost of the shares. Your broker now gives you a margin call. This allows them to sell your shares back onto the open market - this is typically in both your and your broker's favor. The bad news about this unique scenario with GME, is that those shares went back onto the open market as a result of your shares being sold. You make some small profits, but that sell action drives the price down. On a large scale, this could cause a sell off.

If you have enough cash in your account to cover the position, then you're good to hold and this post doesn't apply to you.",1612153596,glk96hr,8,wallstreetbets

I'm sure they're already in the process of trying to get that to happen. And even if nothing changes, I'm sure hedge funds are gonna think twice about shortstocking for awhile. We just gotta enjoy this while we can, and not let regret make a sour outlook! 

For me, at least, there's nothing I really could've done differently. I had no clue what was going on with GME until last Monday, and even then, I didn't take it seriously until Wednesday (and then bought my shares Thursday morning). I thought it was some flash-in-the-pan thing where only a few would get lucky. So there's no point in wishing I had perfect hindsight and bought earlier, cause I had no clue what was going on!

john_flubber,"Ultimately the point of the short squeeze is that the buyer will be short sellers (hedge funds). Buying stocks is part of closing out a short position. As it currently stands, the short % is over 100, that 128% or whatever you see elsewhere on this sub, meaning that if every short were to close out they would have to buy all outstanding shares plus another 28%.

Hyteright,"Not a financial advisor; glassy smooth brain.

I think it’s end of the week, but be aware that not all shorts/shares are represented there due to the artificial shares shorters can make. The better gauge to determine what state we are in is to look at volume. As volume decreases, price volatility increases. Before the short squeeze takes off, prices will be all over the place! Look to volume to really see when it takes off.

At least that’s my theory - anyone know if this is accurate?

DivySuresh,"Short version:Fuck the bastards who try to throw their weight around and bully companies. + Paper hands are for bitches. + **I WAS FUCKING BORN WITH THESE BABIES 💎🙌💎🙌**.

Long Version:Because every day the shorts don't close they bleed millions. What people fail to recognize is regardless of the short squeeze a lot of these firms will never financially recover. Do you think any investor in their right mind is going to be willing to pay 2 &amp; 20 after this?

I'm doing this to clean up the stock market. These funds use leverage to inflate their notional exposure to the market. This risk is what makes normal financial downturns catastrophes for millions of ordinary people. The Fed is forced to keep interest rates low, because if they raise them these Wall Street fucks will have to de-lever so much so quickly that they'll tank the market. At least in the short term.

Over leveraged HF and shady dealings on Wall Street have fucked the individual investor. For too long have people looked the other way. This is a ticking time bomb and what we do exposing this is genuinely going to help the economy. But only if people do something about it. Talk to people, ***Vote*** or at the very least choose with your wallet. If companies resort to using unfair tactics to remedy their fuckups I won't do business with them, and neither should you.

I bought in relatively cheap (sub 100) and I know that there's a ridiculously low chance I don't make money off of this. I'm fine holding the line because the longer these guys shit bricks, the higher chance they don't make this kind of mistake again. I want to put these guys off (over) short selling for the rest of their careers. Every time they even think about (over) shorting a stock I want these bastards to remember how a bunch of retail investors, the very same people they call 'dumb money' fucked them over for billions.

I want my kids to one day trade in a stock market that is fair, one that lets anyone invest into their future regardless of how many 0's are in their bank account. A stock market that works to fund and value companies fairly. Wall Street thinks they're the be all and end all when it comes to valuating these businesses. These wall street guys may be: ""tHe sMaRtEsT gUyS iN tHe rOoM"" but they haven't gotten one thing through their thick skulls yet. They don't determine the value of a stock, the people do.

I saw that D1 Capital, Point72 Capital and Maplelane had double digit losses so far to AUM. I am hoping WSB can force them to all unwind.

That will be 600 or 700 Billion worth of stock being dropped on the market at once. It will be a glorious dip buying opportunity for all involved. 

If you look up zebra spreads or butterflies you can probably profit from thos type trades very nicely. I know my SPX fly did quite well, which allowed me to get 5 more shares GME.

Spirit117,"It's not like I'm banned from checking my phone at work lol, but it is a job after all. I will hold 3 shares come tmrw morning (currently 2) so it's not like I'm going to make millions off this unless the stock really blows up. However 3 shares could go to most of my yearly salary (especially after tax-say it goes to 10k each, that's 30k which is probably more than my yearly salary after tax and other deductions, yes Ik I'll have to pay tax on 30k too).

But, I do still want to make sure I'm doing a good job since I am new and I like the job and unless this goes high enough to melt down the entire economy with it I'll still need this job.

Also, I haven't advertised that I'm invested in this. You never know who's not going to be on your side when push comes to shove if this causes a wider economic meltdown, and you can best believe the media will blame us instead of wall street if that happens.",1612153808,glk9jx0,2,wallstreetbets

Posting in here hoping someone will make this a full post cause this needs to be discussed and brings up larger issues here at wsb. Ok here goes....These posts touting why not to buy silver are based on a meaningless conspiracy theory. First off HEDGE FUNDS OWN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STOCKS AND POSITIONS. Are you really not going to invest in a company just because a hedge fund owns it?? Good luck... you’ll be left with almost no options. This leads me to my next point which is SINCE WHEN DO PEOPLE HERE GIVE A CRAP ABOUT JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS?? I thought the goal was to make money. Why lord why all of a sudden did this stop being about tendies and start being about emotional bullst and sticking it to the boomers. WHO TF CARES. The only reason I’m pissed is because the DD on here for longing silver is some of the smartest DD I’ve ever read on this sub. It makes so much sense and people are all of a sudden campaigning against it just because Citadel is on the long side??? I say again, who TF cares??  Citadel and other hedge funds are on the long side of damn near every stock / commodity out there, so why does that matter at all??

Millenial_Subutai,"We actually haven't had capitalism for a very long time. What we have is a essentially socialism for the elites, and restricted capitalism for the middle and lower classes. Because of fractional reserve banking, currency is created out of thin air and then you are charged interest for this currency that doesn't exist all while you lose purchasing power. So the reason why those of use who are Millenials feel like we can't make ends meet is not because of capitalism, or even socialism, its because our currency no longer has value. 

Example, in 1960 minimum wage was around $1:25 hr. To show the purchasing power of that $1.25, 5 90% silver quarters has a value of about $27 dollars today. So in 1960 on minimum wage you earned the equivalent of $27.00 an hour when adjusted for inflation. 

We lost our purchasing power. Thats why this push for Silver now is so important because it is taking back our purchasing power.",1612153833,glk9ldu,1,wallstreetbets

dgoske84,"I've tried creating a thread to post this long message several times today. It has been denied every time. I realize in this thread not many will see it but the mods won't let me create a thread.

I've been buying AMC off and on for awhile now. I think my average share price is around $14.25 a share. I have 2 separate accounts and have bought it at a bunch of different levels for a couple years. I have a total of 4872 shares. I tried  creating a thread but it is denied every time. I don't see an option to add photos when commenting in a thread. On Wednesday I got calls from a bunch of people telling me I should sell the stock when it was $15-$20. For better or worse I did not sell. I'm willing to hold whether AMC goes to $100+ or it goes to $0.

I've thought it was a good business for years and I love the movie theatre. I've had so many great times in the theatres over the last 25+ years. I probably go around 35 times a year now. Nothing can beat a great theatre experience! I have paid to see movies in theatres I can watch at home in 4K on a big tv for free. I know there are pitfalls mostly because of cell phones. Thankfully most theatres have spent endless money on upgrades to seating. The good theatres near me you only have to worry about seeing someone's phone if they are in your row with how the new seating is set up. So I've had pretty good luck at being able to still go to the theatre and be able to enjoy watching the movies.

For those that don't follow it closely, 2019 was the highest grossing year worldwide in the history of the box office. AMC also had higher concession growth than any of the other major theatre chains. Before the pandemic hit AMC Stubs had around 1 million members paying $20-$24 per month. Yet the stock was virtually at its all time low of around $7 a share. In 2016 it was around $33 per share. Even in the middle of 2019 the price was $16 a share. The only reason it got down to $7 around 6 months after that was because of the piece of shit short sellers. There is no way the company stock price should of ever been $7 a share in December of 2019/January 2020.

I realize it got down to $2 a share because of the pandemic. Yet basically every other company skyrocketed after hitting all time lows in March. Casino stocks, while closed and not pulling in a single dollar, went up 4-10x on their stock prices. Why has nothing happened for AMC until now? It's because of the short selling pieces of shit.

I'm holding and you should too. I think the chances for AMC are basically 50/50. If WSB members continue to buy and hold AMC could go to $100 or way more. Maybe even a few hundred a share. If everyone panics and sells it will probably go back down to $2 because of the shorts. If there was no revolution happening with WSB and no ridiculous shorting of AMC I still think it should be over $20 a share. AMC has avoided bankruptcy. Once everything starts returning to normal in 3-6 months all the new movies will be coming out in theatres. Everyone will be going to packed theatres again. The current slate from May of 2021 to the end of 2022 if nothing else gets pushed back will be the best 1 1/2 years the box office has ever seen.

GME and AMC are the only 2 stocks WSB members should be buying and holding if you care about making the shorts lose billions. These are the 2 stocks we can crush the shorts on. These are the 2 stocks that if everyone holds we cannot lose. I know most will say Im biased but even if I had no stake in it I would say out of all the stocks people are talking about to beat the shorts you should only be buying and holding GME and AMC. I think AMC has more potential because of how much lower the share price is. Plus how much GME has already gone up. For example I think a new WSB member or a new stock purchaser is more likely to buy and hold 20 some shares of AMC at $13-$15 a share than 1 share of GME at $300+. Either way if everyone sticks to the plan, GME and AMC stock holders should win!

When I was working I was taking home less than $40k a year. If I can hold close to 5000 shares of AMC at a high average price you can too!",1612153847,glk9m9d,274,wallstreetbets

DarksunSpeaks,"So I bought NOK as part of the hype of GME/AMC/NOK.

Well looking into this company I really think they are on the verge of blowing up because they are not the same company from 20 years ago. In my research:

Financials are solid:

They leaped frogged to 5G patients before other, securing licensee funding for future:

Starbeets,"Okay, that's what I thought a limit was, but last weekend, when I tried to order a limit buy on NOK that was $1 over the current price, the order was rejected for being too far over or under the price. I tried to do it dozens of times for different BANGs for different amounts and nothing but an order to limit buy set to the current price or a few cents over would be accepted. The reject note said something about checking to make sure I was buying the right stock. I'm so new I don't even know if that was condescending. 

What was that about? Was that part of special restrictions on BANG+ stocks?",1612153859,glk9myo,1,wallstreetbets

Everyone talking anti-silver are those who stupidly went 100% in GME to kill a smaller fish. You don't have to go 100% anything. 

I'm 10% GME which i won't sell. 60% Silver as it's a no-brainer, which i won't sell and then 30% other stonks I like.

Gump24601,"I've been unemployed since Dec 2019, tried to change industries last year and thanks to the pandemic I'm back at square one. Actually worse, as I've been eating into savings and can't even get back into the industry I was in or receive government benefits.

Rationally, I should have stayed put, not bothered entering in the market and kept my hard earned in the bank to help pay off the mortgage. But that changed when I saw WSB rally last week, hold, and stick it to the hedge fund bullies.

And here I am. Bought $GME 10@320 on Friday at close, representing the little guy. I'm not expecting a 200/1000/10000% return, anything life-changing for myself at all. But I'm going to be holding. Holding for someone that can now pay off their student loan, buy a house or even put food on the god damn table. Holding to stick it to the hedge fund fatcat vampires that can fuck right off. Holding to make a difference and have a positive change to how the stock market is run in future that reduces retail being the damn bag-holders.

So my message to those that are nervous, thinking of selling or not sure what to do:  
Stay strong. Hold. The more that retail investors hold the harder it's going for those hedgies to sell shorts at a lower rate.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: HOLD $GME.  💎🙌🏻

atx78701,"A call is an option to buy any time during the option period. The option has a  a premium which is paid to the seller of the call. 

Typically you would buy an out of the money call. So if the price is $10 today and you think it will rise to $20, you could buy a  15c.  It would be cheap if no one else thinks the price will rise that high. Each call represents an option to buy 100 shares. This lets you control a lot of shares without a lot of money, just the premium. But if the option doesnt get in the money, then you lose your entire bet.

You can also buy in the money calls. For example if the price is 10, you could buy an $8 call, the price would be the difference between 8 and 10 plus the premium

Shorts could buy in the money calls that would essentially allow them to exit without necessarily moving the market by buying shares. However at the time they exercise the call someone needs to go find those shares. The clearing houses apparently use statistics to estimate how many they will need and start buying them in advance.",1612153965,glk9tp3,5,wallstreetbets

And I understand that you want to make a difference and stand up to people using the language but I’m just being honest that I don’t think they will change their minds. And to speak on what you think is a “disgusting cop out”, isn’t that the same logic applied to the reclaiming of the word “queer”? I can see that you might not see the group posting on wsb as an oppressed group and therefore not allowed to reclaim the word but my point stands as I do see that potentially for capability to reclaim and ultimately it’s the same logic. At the end of the day, if you looked into the innate culture of wsb you can see that while yes, the r word and a word is often used in a derogatory manner, by and large it’s mostly seen in a comradeship capacity.

1. Is there a way to verify this? As I understand it's easy to disappear these fake shares because they aren't going through clearing houses.

2. What will be the effects of this, if its true? I'm thinking less about GME which is probably beyond predicting, but the overall market. Is there an obvious knock-on effect to this being true? What magnitute would it be?

3. I'm curious as to why, if this is happening, hedge funds are on the decline and aren't actually performing that well. To me it raises a lot of questions about hedge funds and shorts in general, that something like this is happening and they're on the decline.

This is all coming from someone very green to the market. I barely have the understanding to think up questions like these let alone begin to answer them so I'd love to hear what you boys say.",1612153993,glk9viz,2,wallstreetbets

BGArtman,"I bought 4K shares in AG, a silver mining company, before I heard about WSB.  
Was able to buy 10 GME on the dip on Fri. 💎🙌💎

I see where you're coming from and I expect a similar push from the current administration. Mandating green tech in all federal buildings and embassies. Which would drive the price of silver up. Regardless of how much silver is actually available. 

Add to that, with all of the attention to GME and now SLV as another opportunity that most WSB are calling a distraction, I think that a squeeze on SLV will become a self fulfilling prophesy. I know that Citadel is in on silver too, and, I expect that the green tech mandates will likely come about very soon in coordination with Wallstreet to recover after the squeeze is squoze. Honestly, I think it's inevitable. 

I took pos in AG with the expectation that it would explode and still plan to benefit from that.

Just a retard's opinion  
not financial advice

TLDR: 💎🙌💎$GME, but imo, Wallstreets' recovery play will be AG/SLV bc it's been manipulated undervalue for a decade. I don't know if there could be a squeeze on either, but, retail could benefit across the board.",1612154016,glk9wyf,1,wallstreetbets

# Amazon holiday sales jump as one-day shipping pays dividends, stock up 13%

By [Jeffrey Dastin](https://www.reuters.com/journalists/jeffrey-dastin), [Akanksha Rana](https://www.reuters.com/journalists/akanksha-rana)

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc [AMZN.O](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O) on Thursday posted holiday quarter results well above expectations as the expansion of its one-day shipping program came under budget and membership in its Prime loyalty club notched a 50% rise in two years.

Shares soared as much as 13% in after-hours trade, putting the online retailer back in the $1 trillion market capitalization club. If the share gain holds on Friday, it will be the biggest daily jump for Amazon since October 2017.",1612154017,glk9x12,-6,wallstreetbets

There are more hedge funds that will take their place, waiting to over short another business that may get missed by others. Everyone here is telling people to buy $gme, telling them what to do, and when I say only do so within your means suddenly I'm the one trying to decide why people would invest? I'm literally saying do not listen to people telling you to invest, only invest if you have done research, are willing to take a risk, and understand what you are doing.

This isn't a crusade, this is market dynamics. Some smart people here saw what the hedge funds were doing, and found a way to beat them. That doesn't mean for every single individual longing gme is a good idea.",1612154076,glka0o1,0,wallstreetbets

Coreadrin,"Banks way prefer inflation to deflation.  They are still getting repaid in denomination that is easier to acquire, so its default rates go down. Deflation means the assets that underwrite their loans go \*down\* in value and they have to provision the difference to keep their capital ratios in  line.  That's why the 08 crisis fucked them so hard - they had to absorb the asset writedowns with the defaults.  That's why they got rid of mark to market and replaced it with Mark to Magic.  


If we get into another default spiral, silver is going down, everything is going down, and the  banks will have more exposure to this than anyone.  Debt defaults drive \*up\* the price and value of the dollar because it becomes a race to repay debt - the debt grows more expensive every day as it is more expensive to acquire dollars to repay it, and the debt must be repaid in what it is denominated in.  There is about 6.5 trillion in hard cash and demand deposits (like chequing accounts and money market funds) out there, and about 50 Trillion in private debt and public debt, plus god only knows how many derivatives instruments that aren't counted (hundreds of billions at minimum).  Plus the US exports over a trillion dollars (domestic dollars into the eurodollar system) a year through the trade deficit.  


TL:DR If this starts the chain reaction, silver is tanking with everything that is not cold, hard cash.",1612154086,glka18d,3,wallstreetbets

Drewforpresident2020," Thesis:  A thing is worth as much as someone will pay for it.  If each share of  GME has two owners and a counterparty who is indebted to one of those  owners for the value of a share of GME, why shouldn't everyone on the  planet spend all the money they can afford to gamble with to buy shares  of GME until each share has one owner?  The shorts will buy.  They must.   The question is when, and at what price.  The value of GME has nothing  to do with Gamestop and everything to do with game theory.  The shorts  placed a wager.  Their reasons for placing that wager do not matter.   Only the terms of their wager matter.  What were those terms?  At some  point in the past, the shorts decided to borrow the value of one  Gamestop share \*now\*, and in exchange, they agreed to repay the value of  one Gamestop share \*later\*.  They had beliefs about what a Gamestop  share represents, and beliefs about what makes a Gamestop share  valuable, but their beliefs do not matter to me.  What matters to me is  that when the value of a Gamestop share times the number of shares an  entity sold short is greater than the value of that short seller's  current liquid assets plus the amount their creditors will allow them to  borrow, the short seller is forced to lock in losses and spend all of  their money to purchase Gamestop shares to cover their bet, ending up  with nothing and transferring their wealth to the shareholders.  Our  target isn't a price.  Our target is one owner per share.  Fuck the  shorts.  Let them double down.  And quadruple down.  And octuple down.   More shorts is more money for the shareholders when the shorts get  liquidated because they don't have enough assets to equal the value of  the shares they promised to repay. I see no reason why we shouldn't  continue to buy GME at any price until the shorts have closed their  positions.  The value of a Gamestop share is the dollar value at which  every short seller has closed their position and each share has a single  owner.  No less.  We are playing musical chairs.  Eventually, the music  will stop.  When it does, you will either be part owner of Gamestop, or  you will not.  Owning part of Gamestop will either be worth something,  or it will not.  The music is still playing.  Which is worth more to  you: the number of dollars it currently costs to purchase a share of  Gamestop, or the prospect of owning one share of Gamestop in the future?   If you're not sure, consider opening your bible to Matthew 25.  I  would say that anyone who asks me to trade my infinite amount of tendies  for their finite amount of tendies is calling me a retard, but I  consider that term to be a badge of honor.  I was reading earlier and I  came across a word which, with regard to GME, was not in my lexicon:  sell.  After much research, I discovered that, in context, the word  meant ""to voluntarily not own GME.""  I must admit, I am too retarded to  understand the concept.  Members of the committee, thank you for reading  my Doctoral Thesis.  If you wish to grant me the title of Doctor of  Retardology, please press the updoot.

TinyPirate,"Let's say they issue new shares at $100 a share (and the longer the price of GME stays up, the more they're going to be able to demand). Is that not a pretty damn good price for GME? Is GME realistically worth $300? Really? I've not seen a single person talk about ACTUALLY company valuation, but I'm pretty confident $100+ is stretching believability.

So they issue shares at $100, the share price immediately plummets to that and then moves around there for the foreseable future. That's still an AMAZING outcome for GME and it would absolutely be in the best interests of the company to do this.",1612154113,glka2uy,0,wallstreetbets

DarkKobold,"&gt; This being said, short positions pay a borrow fee in the form of interest rates, which right now is somewhere between 70 and 80%, meaning for every $100.00 in short position they have open the hedge funds will pay ~$70.00 yearly to hold open. The interesting thing is the more short a ticker gets the higher the borrow rate becomes.

You're making up this fake high horse to make yourself feel righteous - maybe you missed your chance to get in, maybe you genuinely believe what you're saying, who knows - and it's so wildly off-base. I'm in for 140 shares at $107 and I'm holding because I still think the squeeze has yet to happen. Plain and simple. There is no 'fair share' when it comes to stocks, just like anything else in life.

IceDreamer,"I've read this comment thread through and am still confuzzled on one or two things.

So, in concept, I see how you can substitute calls for shares when settling a short position. My question is - Where do the 100 shares come from, and at what point in time? With all the shorts and calls flowing around, the fact is that at some point that call must be turned into 100 shares. Unless... Do you mean that the short buys an _un-exercised_ call option, and gives _that_ to the guy they borrowed their shares from in the first place??

If I were in the position of the person who lent my shares out, I wouldn't be too happy about that! Now I have to go out to a market which may be crashing, and exercise that option. That's bunk, they guy I lent to just left me footing the bill! That's why this explanation seems lacking, I can't figure out this hole.

Second question - If the shorts covered their positions using call options, why do you think the price will rise tomorrow? Prices rise when buying is higher than selling, but they covered their positions, so they don't need stock to cover, so they don't buy...

What am I missing? Feels like we need a timeline/flowchart haha",1612154161,glka5ug,1,wallstreetbets

Just cuz hedgefunds aren't the number one doesn't mean we have to like em.

ArcDelver,"That isn't the issue, but the fact that robinhood lets you purchase stocks before your funds are cleared actually compounds this problem.

What I'm talking about doesn't even have to do with that. Say you have added $100 to your RH and it has fully cleared and is sitting there as cash in your RH account. When you go to buy something, there is typically a 10-20% amount that the DTC requires RH to have on hand to cover that purchase on top of the purchase price. According to RH, the DTC raised that to 100% for GME and other stocks this past week. Meaning that when you buy $100 worth of GME stock, RH also has to have another $100 in their account with the DTC to cover that purchase. Going back to the instant funds access, if your funds haven't yet cleared, that means RH needs $200 on their books to cover this trade.

Selling stock is a whole different beast because all that is done on the other side of the trade so it doesn't impact their liquidity at all.",1612154179,glka6xw,13,wallstreetbets

King-Stormin,"It’s a risky business practice to allow people to buy on margin. Which is what every new user is doing when purchasing stocks before the money actually clears through robinhood which takes a day or two.

They can’t legally halt selling, but they can limit buying due to their own fiscal responsibilities. 

They are the middle man. They are taking on the risk. 
Dumb college kids or people that don’t understand how brokerages work think they are conspiring against the regular joe, which is their whole market. 

Dumb people on average believe in more conspiracy theories, and this is an obvious one if you use pascals razor. 

Hedge funds are focused on short ladder attacks to scare away the autists. The percentage of retail investors is a laughable minority compared to firms out there. Monetarily wise it just makes sense logically. Believing that the price will shoot through the moon is ridiculous. Hedge funds will cut their losses or the government will step in anyways.

These hedge funds will crash and burn, but they will get a new job that pays 250k while we all go back to our dumb 60k jobs and work 40+ hours a week.",1612154186,glka7d6,1,wallstreetbets

KennyG-Man,"You’re spot on.  That’s what will happen. Whoever guesses when the music stops correctly will make money.  You can’t stop them from making money without stacking the deck with legislation or something that is in principal anti-capitalist.  I think even if they managed to force short positions to close and put a moratorium on short selling, it still would not end well.  

But, as holders you don’t have to lose all your money.  The endgame could be something like:
1. Watch the actual short numbers.. Don’t sell anything until they drop to 50% or so.  You have them cornered.
2. Take your cost basis out at least.. be invulnerable.  Pay some bills.  Win.
3. Hold the rest for a year.  Reap any remaining profits at capital gains rates.",1612154209,glka8sq,1,wallstreetbets

That cash flow is poored into massively leveraged speculative bets and manipulation of public opinion when those positions go south. The whole thing is jacked to the tits with leverage. Since citadel cant make money off of retail retards only doing one thing because its them on the other side of the trade, it means they dont have cash flow to pay their margin call. Right now they have no cash flow, theyre upside down AF on a bunch of positions and eventually theyll have to bail on the positions because theyre leverage ratios will exceed the legal maximum, and the whole this is so massively political they wont get bailed out in time.

ImAnEngnineere,"I can only share what I did. I sold at open on Friday and that turned out to be ATH for the day. I saw the premarket climbing, and since my last lot had a $290 cost basis, I was okay with anything over $300. Turns out that was a good move.

My non-financial self test is that if I'm nervous and worried, then selling out of a position profits me not only money at times, but also some inner peace and time to re-assess my trading approach.

I think part of what happened is that RH allows buying stocks instantly while waiting for deposits to clear and chances are Tuesday/Wednesday (when this story pretty much gained national attention) they probably had record sign ups. These new accounts probably had a fair number of fractional buying.

So for every new account that bought fraction share, Robinhood had to buy the whole share anyways without any money from the new account because it takes 2-3 business days for that to transfer.

craigc123,"This is half right. Don’t fall for buying $SLV which is a paper representation of the price of silver and not backed by anything, but if you can get your hands on physical silver, you absolutely should buy it. What we have seen happening with GameStop and a few over-leveraged hedge funds panicking and losing billions is _nothing_ compared to what a silver short squeeze could do to banks and the foundation of the economic system itself.

Banks have been manipulating the price of silver for decades now with the help of regulators using naked shorts. This means there are more short positions in silver than ounces of silver that exist in the world. If they get squeezed there is a good chance that they won’t have the physical silver to cover their losses. Don’t sell your $GME and go all in on silver, but don’t be fooled into thinking there isn’t a play here just because some hedge funds may be long $SLV.",1612154330,glkag8y,1,wallstreetbets

bench_dogg,"As far as I know (which isn't much as I eat crayons), the only silver that moves the spot price of silver (which SLV is based) is the silver in the COMEX vault.  Your online dealer will sell you bullion come Monday am at Spot + some number, maybe $5, maybe $100.  Whatever it is, it is not going to move spot silver or SLV that much, but it will change the price of actual silver you can buy.  I don't think the COMEX boys will come hunting your silver eagles, they have to reprocess the silver and put it into a form COMEX will certify, which is a PITA.

Skirt a question? No. Avoid conversation with someone who's comment history is filled with unproductive antagonizing. Yes.

But ok, I'll humor you. The context is that this was done with selfish intent by the retail investor to ensnare hapless individuals with a momentum play and then dump them with the bags.

That is not the case at all. The goal is to leave MMs with the bags, not retail. If investors continue to act selflessly, as they have so far with this stock, that will be the overwhelming end result.

Bippolicious,"Someone on twitter said there were only 3 posts on WSB in the top 50 re silver and they were all waring people off. But obviously silver IS moving, it is up about 7% premarket Sunday evening. And dealers have run out of Silver coins and bars.  But then again silver has moves like this from time to time. Silver is definitely underpriced with it being at a 1000 year low the other day on the Gold/Silver ratio (number of ounces of Silver to buy one ounce of gold). Also inflation showing its head. But the big banks can short it very aggressively and drive it back down - until they can't. It may go up a lot over time but not in a straight line. It may be having a breakout, and it may get squeezed, but it won't necessarily be from WSB kids, they might just get media credit for it.

Slim-Nani,"1. You simply can't link between your luck getting 200% returns to their UI.You might as well lose all your money and then some, you wouldn't blame them I guess.
2. I agree it runs deeper than them. still, they handled it lousy. Even if it is ""just"" a matter of cash reserves- I wouldn't want to rely on a broker that might limit my financial activity due to his lack of funds.
3. I doubt the IPO is so promising now after the significant PR hit they brought on themselves, but I don't know anything about IPO so I can't really comment.I'd just say that I wouldn't stay in a broker I'm not happy with just for the right to score some bucks in a future IPO.

I am currently using IBKR, their PC UI screams 90's although their mobile app is decent for me.I consider leaving them for the sole reason of unjustified trading halting and limiting me as a customer to do as I wish with my money.

Mitchmac21,"Like you say the shares can just disappear so we can’t find any info on that.

I think the overall market will generally decline the more GME goes up because in theory the greater the price the higher the loss for any hedge fund holding the shorts. If we get to a point of liquidation of these hFs from the clearing houses, the brokers/clearing houses are next in line to take on the short debt. If they take on this debt the price could moon to extraordinary prices for single shares in the squeeze further increasing the debt of these institutions.

Layingpipe69,"/silverbugs silver has typically been 1:15 price range of gold currently like 1:75 price ratio. Silver is also used in technology like solar panels. Silver market is shorted constantly to keep the price low. Currently ~27 per Troy ounce. If it was how it. Or ally compared to gold would be ~150ish. I have 30 ounces and it’s fun to look at and cuddle with. If everyone had silver there would be an average of 8 oz per person with the current supply.

admiralvic,"Well, there are a couple things to keep in mind.

&gt; I also don't see why they can't just keep swapping a million shares back and forth between them.

Like, even if other groups with stocks wanted to do this, the sheer amount they would need would absolutely result in some serious SEC problems. Remember, worst estimates put them over 100 percent, meaning, for 1 million shares would need to be cycled through the system at least 70 times to clear it. They have already done some really bad things, but imagine the SEC allowing them to freely trade **more than the companies total stock** well under the markets price just to prevent taking a hit.

Unique situation or not, just imagine how many people would question anything. If they got away with it, consider how many insane things they could do in the future. 

&gt; I don't see why the hedge funds can't just negotiate a lower interest rate with whoever they're supposed to be paying or even have it suspended because of such a crazy situation.

Also, don't forget that these are people who would basically need to agree to lose potentially billions because another company made a poor choice. Not to mention, again, it creates potential negative situations in the future.

The stock market basically needs people to believe in it, otherwise it's a bunch of rich people doing whatever they want and making a killing. The second we make making a massive screw up like this a mulligan, it could realistically turn any situation where the common man gets ahead into a mulligan. And, most importantly, I am getting sick and tired of bail outs.

I make $15 an hour and if I so much as sass someone, I could get written up to terminated. Melvin Capital, from what I understand, shorted GameStop to turn a profit and moved towards making them bankrupt to increase profits, potentially leading to roughly 30,000 employees losing their job, and failed so spectacularly bad they're out billions, but because it's unexpected it's not okay and that isn't acceptable.",1612154727,glkb4i1,3,wallstreetbets

Be honest and tell people - especially the newbies that they’re almost certainly going to lose all their money.

I take no issue with you guys doing your thing... but the hypocrisy of saying your trying to fix the markets and make it so Everton gets their fair share is utter bullshit and you know it.

That’s my objection... 

And it’s an honest concern.  I work for a charity... I don’t want you to see a whole host of new people lining up at food banks and shelters because they think you people are going to help them.

This is t about hedge funds. It’s not about everyone getting their fair share.

It’s about you people getting rich by any means necessary...

VioletObstruction,"Just checked apmex, and physical silver looks like it's around $15 over spot. Totally speculating here and have no training on this, but it could be that the precious metals guys are seeing some signal booster reddit reposts that this might be the time finally that they're finally right about how much those metals are really worth. They're buying up all of it for a massive premium before the world ending shortage or whatever it is they think this means.

What that will do to the paper price, who even knows since it's like a totally alternate reality, but in the meantime silver coins are worth like $35-40 / oz if you have some.",1612154762,glkb6kr,1,wallstreetbets

SharkTankBets,"Just bought 100 oz silver (maple leaf Canadian 1oz)  on APMEX this weekend- site was slow and I signed up for alert when they had stock.  I was alerted bought and maybe an hour later all sold out again.

Received this email from the CEO of apmex, says they are stretched thin, expect rapid rise in prices and this is unprecedented demand!

“To our valued customers,
APMEX Statement On Current Market Conditions:

In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers. For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week. Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week. 

Any Precious Metal dealer will take a long position in the futures market to protect against spot price exposure when the markets open. We do this because it is our goal not to take a speculative position on metal. The weekends are unique as we are not able to real-time hedge our position. We took an aggressive position this weekend, but clearly could not have predicted the volumes that were seen. We have partnerships around to world that allowed us to cover these long positions, but only to a point. Once we exceeded our comfort levels, we had little choice but to stop the sale of Silver on our website. This was a difficult decision to make and unprecedented in our history. 

As we evaluate the markets, it is difficult to know where Silver's price and demand will go in the coming day and weeks. APMEX is highly capitalized and has more than $150 million in inventory to support demand. We have made strategic decisions to procure additional metal, locking up any metal we can find in the market place. We suspect premiums will rise and rise quickly, as we are seeing significant increases in our costs, when we can even locate the metal. It is also highly likely that we will need an additional day or two to fill orders based on current order counts. The one guarantee we can make to our customers is that you will only be sold metal that is on-site, or we have procured the metal with a firm commitment date from our partners. In markets like this, we feel this is the best approach a retailer can take, as no one can predict product availability.

We want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding during these turbulent times. APMEX prides itself on best in class service and delivering on promises to our customers.
Sincerely,
Ken Lewis
CEO, APMEX”",1612154772,glkb76r,3,wallstreetbets

bigorangemachine,"Okay I really hate conspiracies but let's also remember BRE-X.

Point 1: WSB may have inequitably proven the counterfeit shares conspiracy and this push on silver is to make us move our meager investments elsewhere. Gold and Silver are VOLATILE as all hell. They look stable but they can crash overnight in the international market causing panics in other markets.

Point 2: Gold and Silver mines discoveries can crash the market. BRE-X false mine announcement threw the market into a VOLATILE state. A falsely announced mine can fuck the silver and gold markets.

When have I seen gold and silver go up... when uncertain presidents take power (Bush (re-elecion) and Obama but not Trump) and huge natural disasters for some reason.

So a run on silver is a trap. Unless our buy on GME destabilizes the market so hard people lose all faith in USD :/

Honestly, it feels like it'd be stupid of them to not dilute or otherwise capitalise on this at some point - raising capital and/or securing credit from banks and such will be difficult for them now because from what I've heard they don't like when a company has volatile share pricing and will dismiss any applications on that basis alone.

P0300,"I was thinking today that one of the things about this sub I love really gets overlooked by the commentary around it. I have lurked here for a long time and don’t post much but I feel like this could use some attention. Whenever I see someone posting that is considering taking scary risk (do I mortgage my house, skip rent, max out credit cards?) they are always hit with a barrage of people trying to talk them out of that gamble. The core community here is all about high risk for almost certain failure but they are able to keep the important things in focus and project that feeling to the newer people here. There are jokes about being long $Rope but if anyone seems actually suicidal they always get supportive responses. I just feel like that is an under appreciated aspect that I hope the 5 million new people here can come to understand.

This may also explain why bunch of RH ITM calls got prematurely redeemed, esp at the bottom of the dip near end of day. I bet Citadel forced call redemption and did a sleight of hand. It cost them the same, but instead of us getting the shares they got it and sent the cash to RH instead.

Read an article Wednesday afternoon about how r/wsb was beating wall street at there own game. Hopped into the sub (sadly I haven't been subbed, I might have seen this earlier and gotten way lower) and an hour later knew enough to make a Robinhood acct.

I bought a fractional share of GME for 50 bucks.

Thursday was the day when it went from a fun game to personal for me, and when RH lifted some restrictions I bought 2 full shares Friday morning.

None of the deposits I made to buy the fractional share nor the 2 full shares have cleared my bank yet, so essentially Robinhood had to buy 3 shares for me without getting any of my money at all.

I suspect this is case for hundreds of thousands or even millions of new users too.

[deleted],"I dunno, as weary as I am it seems to line up too good...chart brings a 20 week cup and handle, big picture we got a 40 year cup and handle!!! The buying lately has been insane. There’s currently 800k (80m shares) set to expire ITM at 30$ March 19 on $SLV, that’s ~2.5b in silver. Another 600k contracts (60m shares) between 30$ and 50$ on March 19 means ANOTHER ~2.5b. Mid 2020 Eric sprott spent 1.5b on 75m ounces of physical silver at 20$/oz, this drove the price up 50%. There’s 40% less silver than gold above ground, silver trades at 1/73 the price of gold while is produced naturally at an 8:1 ratio. Anyone with a brain can tell you this makes no sense. What this tells me is it’s like a spring that been coiled up, waiting to release its energy and its right under everyone’s nose. I remember being young and learning gold was like 1400 while silver was 10$..made no sense to me then, still doesn’t now. Even if this is the banks playing fuckery, they biggest 6 hold ~43m shares of SLV combined, that’s a measly 6.7%. There’s going to be more calls ITM March 16 at open tomorrow then their holdings. It’s a no brainer. Even if this is the banks trying to draw us in, the conditions couldn’t be more against them, and it’s going to backfire hard. This one ain’t just us, the pressure has been building all year. The heavy buying over the past weeks has not been WSB, it wasn’t on the radar before Wednesday. There’s big, smart money already behind this. I’m not trying to take away from gme here, but there can be more than one event unfolding before us. Can’t walk around with tunnel vision when something so technically obvious is happening. GME may have been the catalyst to a new strategy, one that big money can get behind. One with much bigger sharks to prey on. Please don’t dismiss this opportunity, the signs are all there. Might be a good idea to diversify some spare change, can’t buy half a share of gme so we will have some change to spare. 

Side note: I really think funds and big money are looking at what’s happening to gme and thinking we’re taking this and using it on Jp. Lost big in January, time to get some gains back.",1612154889,glkbeeg,4,wallstreetbets

ladyonyxperegrine,"To be fair... I definitely identify with the kid. I'm 32, disabled, have a special needs 7 year old while my husband is also disabled, he works and has a pretty great career. He works very hard and we do OK, but we also help a lot of people who need it, before and during the pandemic making all resources scarce for us. We managed to adjust the budget pretty hard for AMC stock, but we're only able to put $400 in. I was on my own since I was 14 and while I've been very lucky, I've never been able to have a safety net and my abusive parents would literally use me ever asking for help in any form as an invitation to abuse me or demand time with our son which would undoubtedly lead to them abusing him. 

I've never been able to get ahead or even afford proper treatment for my EDS, POTS, MCAS, PTSD &amp; GAD because this is Murika and my monthly payments for it would literally cost 3x what my husband makes and nothing else. I know people who are in far worse financial situations and I count myself lucky. But even with the conversations my husband and I have been having we intend to use most of the proceeds to finally be able to pay off his car and our house. So we can afford to have someone move in and not even charge them rent if they can help with cleaning and helping our kid as we're both extremely limited physically. 

I've spent my whole life taking care of everyone else and even now with the hope of a financial windfall my instinct is to use it all to help others. At some point I need to learn to take care of myself or give myself permission to be selfish so I can stop being so stressed all the time. 

I am not asking for anything from anyone, chances are I'd feel beyond guilty with an unprovoked offer for various reasons. No matter what happens I know we'll be okay and still help our loved ones... but it sure would be nice if it wasn't a constant struggle to just eat or be able to sleep.",1612154931,glkbgvl,-6,wallstreetbets

I was just trying to keep over 25k one account so I don’t get the day trade limitations and it’s hovered around that for a while. 3-4 months ago when I checked I swear it wasn’t possible transfer out. I know it is now so the only issue will be my GME that’s I’m not selling. Or moving . 

Question though is this. Fuck Robinhood. 

Is there any truth to the fact that they didn’t have the funds available to handle these trades . What does that even mean? How is this thing that big to where Robinhood can’t cover the trades? 

I’m assuming it’s cause it’s bullshit and they are just circle jerking the hedge funds but I’m curious to know if there is any truth. 

Also curious how order flow costs me when it comes to options. I don’t have enough to care about the pennys. But if I have a 100 contracts on an option, would that add up to more than typical trading fees?",1612154933,glkbgzo,1,wallstreetbets

ss_au,"&gt; TLDR; We're probably not even buying and selling actual shares of GME.

And ain't that the story of the effing financial system we live in. The vampire squid on the face of the world, as Matt Taibi rightly labeled one of its main captains. The FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate) industry that instead of providing the lifeblood to the economy sucks it - us - dry.  
 
&gt; What this means for GME is someone is going to have to step up and actually pay up for all of these phantom shares that aren't even supposed to exist. What price they will pay nobody knows.

THUGGERSEASON,"# GME to offer 100mil share issuance; fuck you to shorts and holders alike.  Announces rebranding as The 🛑

By Thuggerseason/🌈🐻

Gamestock shares plummeted Monday on the announcement of the issuance of 100mil new shares at the price of $100 a share.  Short term investors were left holding the bag as long term shareholders praised the company for the share issuance.  CFO James Bell was quoted as saying "" It was a real no-brainer; our company had been in shambles for years.   This 10B influx of capital will provide Gamestop with the capital needed to pay off long term debts and complete our rebranding to The🛑. We're really glad that we can provide a long term benefit to our most valued shareholders.""

Shares opened down more than 70 percent on the announcement, but shorts used the opportunity to cover shorts and buy the offered shares.  Gamestop closed Monday at $112 a share.",1612154959,glkbili,-60,wallstreetbets

McNasty420,"I'm sorry, I'm confused.  What does our injection of money into AMC have to do with American Airlines' stock going up?  I can't open that article.  Is Silver Lake both of their creditors?  And if so, I'm still not understanding how that turned into cash for American Airlines.

Sorry, I just give so few shits about the airline industry.  They are a bunch of greedy fucks with INSANE profits made by completely fucking over their customers every way they possibly can, using their billions of profit to on stockbuybacks, saving NONE of their money for an emergency.  Then the minute they start losing the slightest amount of business for whatever reason, they immediately demand a government bailout by threatening to lay off all their staff.  

Sorry if I'm not throwing a party because the world gets to see American Airlines treat their customers like garbage for another quarter.",1612154980,glkbjx7,2,wallstreetbets

thejameswhistler,"True. The secret is to live life to the fullest instead of working 80 hours a week, and finding someone that wants to fuck as often as you do. And to treat each other right so that urge never fades.

Sadly, the 80 hour thing is the hardest, god knows I know. The system is rigged against us working class folks, because the rich and elite need grist for the mills that keep them rich. Keeping us down is how they ensure they never have to do any work at all. That's why the democratization of access to the almost-real stock market the last five years has been so important (giving normal people a chance to start saving and earning on a higher scale much earlier, even with a very small amount of capital). And why the betrayal and breaking of the system over the past two weeks by RH and others is so hurtful to see. It's naked proof of the cage they want us in. But more and more people see the bars now, and what we're fighting for is to finally tear those bars down once and for all.",1612155038,glkbnc7,6,wallstreetbets

realister,"**$TSLA hates shorts, DD:**

The short interest on **Tesla** is **56,367,815 shares**

Average **$TSLA** daily volume is 	**42,129,010 shares**

that is $47,348,964,600 (**$47 billion**) position and they will probably not ban it from trading

**Elon did it before** and burned the shorts.

Dozens of huge hedge funds bet against Elon Musk since 2013 and they **ALL LOST**.

The short position on **$TSLA** is much **MUCH** larger than all the meme stocks **COMBINED**. In $ amount.

**The future is electric**, GM announced all vehicles will be electric after 2035 others will follow.

 **Elon hates the shorts.**

There's **$50 billion** sitting there for us to take.

Suulace,"My guess is the 3rd option will be used. They'll patch the bleeding interest rates with new funding (they have new investors) and short at the higher prices either with retail investor's shorts they convince brokers to allow to be shorted, or with naked shorts. Once Reddit loses interest again, they hope the lack of new buyers and continued low volume (even with holders) will drive the price down and they can cover their new high shorts for more capital to keep stopping the bleeding until the price naturally drops. Then they can phase out their old shorts over a few weeks, matching supply with demand to stop from raising the price dramatically. It's expensive in interest fees, but it might be less expensive enough to avoid bankruptcy outright, and they can pad losses with shorts from these high peaks.

In fact, having a controlled and limited amount of new retail buyers now could help them when shorting these peaks because they'll have retail investors willing to pay $325+ to get into the GME rocket when other investors and institutional investors would refuse.

verik,"&gt;GME execs need to set up an imminent vote date so that the shares can be recalled and we can get these shenanigans out of the way.

Lmao there is no ""share recall"" button executives hold. Jesus christ this entire fucking sub is a fantasy of financial illiteracy.

&gt;Share price goes up, shorts lose their shorts and GME can move on and turn their omni-channel business into a powerhouse.

Share price goes up in a squeeze to unsustainable levels. If GME execs have any interest in recapitalizing their company, they'd take advantage of the insane equity demand and issue $1-5bn in new shares as a follow-on offering to that shelf registration they filed in december.

Share price doesn't fucking matter if the company can't tap capital markets. And when the short squeeze is done and all the retail buying is through, there won't be a fucking institution that would buy shares from GME in an offering.

If WSB actually wanted to bail out GME, they'd be asking to buy shares direct from an offering. But that is contrary to the mission of fucking over a short position (and not making money for WSB users) so they'll call GME execs traitors if they do issue shares.",1612155192,glkbwfe,-14,wallstreetbets

Let  me tell you why that number is meaningless. Most above ground silver  is  not circulating in financial markets. A good chunk of it is used for   industrial applications and buried in landfills. The two largest  silver  stockpiles are owned by JP Morgan and the SLV ETF, both around  $15B to  $20B. So yes, it's bigger than GME. But it's not THAT much  bigger.

There  are plenty of  reasons to own silver besides betting on an imminent short squeeze.  Silver's price has only gone up 1.4x since the beginning of the Great Financial Crisis (and is down over 40% from its post-recession peak). Over the same time period, M2 has gone up by 2.6x! The supply of silver  has not changed substantially. Other inflation/monetary debasement hedges are at all time highs.

It's possible JPM could be trapped via surging demand for physical delivery. But I think it's even  more likely that at some point, they'll  just stop shorting it. They've  accumulated a huge position and stand to  gain the most when the price  skyrockets. The fair price is probably  somewhere around $50-$75/oz, but  when silver goes off, their best move  will be hoarding supply, letting a huge bubble form, and selling into  strength at levels 5 or 10x  higher than that.

I'm accumulating a position now and whether it happens this week or a month or 3 months from now, I'm not selling until silver goes to the fucking  moon.",1612155212,glkbxla,-24,wallstreetbets

Pretzel911,"It's a bit complicated, but basically every time you purchase or sell a stock, it takes days for everything to move (money, and the stock). So you are using margin until the actual transaction is complete.

You are only on a cash account if you are waiting T+2 days for every transaction to complete

Quick example to help you understand how the time for transaction to clear can cause money issued:

Investor buys $20k in NOK - 20K is now tied up 

Investor sells $21k in NOK - 41K is now tied up

Investor buys $20k in GME - 61k is now tied up

Now I believe they only have to guarantee the transaction with a small percentage, but the higher the volatility of the stock the more money is required.

Stick it to the motherfuckers, but don't lose everything if they cheat the fuck out of us.  Many of you don't remember or were too young to in 2008, but the last time they fucked us in plain sight millions of people lost EVERYTHING, and only ONE of those motherfuckers went to jail, despite everyone from the credit rating agencies, to the SEC, to the Fed, to even the White House being in on the game.

The 100k would enable me to rebuy my childhood home next time it comes for sale which is literally my dream which has seemed out of reach.

So yeah, I got in at 40 with next to nothing to ""lose"", but I'm even terrified for my unrealized gains for money I never ""needed"" in the first place. I literally can't imagine having money I needed, even just a little, in this.

Also, the movie will have to explain what DD is, what FDs are, delineate autism from WSB autism and how that is still different from retardation, which is different from retarded radiation, which is different from being retarded, which is different than ""being retarded longer than remaining solvent"".

They have a better shot of making a movie that's basically a collection of 90 minutes of memes. Of course, the licensing to replay all the source content will be so massive, it will bankrupt Hollywood.

Most options don't get exercised, so a broker like RH might feel safe offering more options than exist. Because no-one hodls forever, right?

DeveloperJ,"Figured as much. I plan to sell roughly 80% a little under the 1k mark. 

I have a gut feeling most people will sell at 1k. And I have a feeling the hedge funds will let it hit 1k and then ladder attack simulating massive sell offs, which will most definitely trigger actual sell offs since this subreddit meme has always been GME to 1k.

and for that reason I’m selling off most of my shares around 900. I’ll leave a few if it does happen to hit 5k, 10k, whatever.

Another issue is there’s a 0% chance the government lets GME crash the market. It will never go to 42069 or whatever people are saying. It’s theoretically possible but won’t happen. 

So I dont know what to do. I wanna hold and sell at 5k, but I’m fairly confident it’ll never reach it. And to protect against hitting 1k, and massive drop off, I’m gonna put a sell order for like 900 and just be happy with it. Leave a few shares just in case.

That’s my exit strategy and everyone should have one. I don’t consider myself a paper hands, but at least for me I don’t trust other people to hold out once we see 1k, especially with the games hedge funds will play.",1612155533,glkcgd1,1,wallstreetbets

Excerpt:

&gt;Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.",1612155616,glkcldj,75,wallstreetbets

I'm also not sure the brokerage funds (like fidelity who stands to make 9B off this trade at the price as it stands today) are going to have the same commitment to holding the line that WSB has. And they control by far the majority of the shares.

Sure they have been enjoying the ride, but they've already made a substantial amount of money.

I_am_just_saying,"Correct, however those big owners are also collecting massively fat interest payments between 30-80% APY for their shares being loaned out right now. 

Some will sell (like Must) but do they sell to the hedgies? who knows... Its just as likely they sold their position to another big fish ready to squeeze? Their incentive to sell is even lower than the average monke that does not get to collect interest. 

Also, IMO the retail position on the stock is a lot larger % than people realize. 

Even if they can wiggle out 5% in an out of market deal they are still hype fucked in the hole. Being able to get a 50% of the total shares to transfer out of the market seems unreasonable... are there actual examples of this ever occurring? Wouldn't they literally not have enough assets on hand to purchase in such a move?",1612155741,glkcsw4,28,wallstreetbets

I think the same can happen here, market will resume after crash (unless this is a super mega corruption and stock market goes to 0; which I very very highly doubt because that would bankrupt or severely affect S&amp;P companies ergo destroying the economy, which would have severe and possibly irreversible consequences)",1612155755,glkctpa,37,wallstreetbets

Duke_Shambles,"AMC is not the same as GME. 

AMC is now in a pretty good spot to recover from the COVID instigated depression on retail. 

AMC has already issued new shares in the light of investment in their business, which my smoothbrained ass agrees was a good plan. It allowed them to get to a place where they don't have to worry about debt and will weather covid.

What will happen when covid is a non-thing? People will go back to the movies. 

Face it, you can't get the theater experience in your house. Well, you might be able to if you have 💎🙌 on GME.

For everyone else. that is an experience you just can't get at home.

Bagholders who didn’t leverage their account accordingly will probably go to sleep for a while. The ones that made money will get to live another day on the sub. 

I currently own $GME and i am okay rr i have. So don’t take my words as i am bearish in GME but all i can say anything that goes up will come down, and it will come down as fast if not faster it came up. 

Lets say theoretically speaking GME hits 1k, majority of the new 3 mil subs on this sub don’t have experience with actually executing orders because they don’t have a clear exit strategy and will get to see that squeeze happen but wont get a chance to get filled and will keep thinking it will go back up. Then all of a sudden in matter of seconds we are down 25-50% of that price you wanted to cash out at. 
A move like GME requires someone who at least know something about the market. I tell me dad to get on some trades i get into, however i think this trade is one of those trades you only watch specially when premiums are this high volatility is through the roof. 

Again i hope we all win and wall street pay. But don’t blame anyone but yourselves when the trade goes against you.

&gt;Failure to deliver is critical when discussing naked short selling. When naked short selling occurs, an individual agrees to sell a stock that neither they nor their associated broker possess, and the individual has no way to substantiate their access to such shares. The average individual is incapable of doing this kind of trade, but an individual working as a proprietary trader for a trading firm and risking their own capital, may have the ability to carry out such an order. Though it would be considered illegal for them to do so, some such individuals or institutions may believe the company they short will go out of business, and thus in a naked short sale they may be able to make a profit with no accountability.",1612155800,glkcwd4,14,wallstreetbets
