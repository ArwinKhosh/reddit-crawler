Now, controlling it is all that matters, and thankfully some help is on the way. I love every country and every people in this continent + GB + Eire, and the selfless doctors and nurses who are willing to help their brothers 3000 km away are the very best of who we are. They, and all the health professionals around the world deserve much greater appreciation (meaning working conditions and generous salaries, not empty words) everywhere, they're true European heroes.\n\nThe EU can't be just about politicians in suits in a huge room in Brussels. It should be a project for peace and cooperation among peoples that, below the superficial disagreements, share most of who they are.",

I pointed this out since that contrasts with Student Movements in Colour Revolutions. \n\nIt's **potentially** because while the main people behind it wanted to install Democracy, they needed support of others that didn't support it as much despite agreeing with Decolonization.\n\nWhile we celebrate the 25th of April as the transition to Democracy, many argue that the failed coup of 25th of November 1975 was just as crucial to ensure it.",

However, having seen the wall and the doorway myself, I strongly believe that to be true.\n\nDebatable? Really? Do you really believe fascist propaganda?\n\nThis was the official version by the fascist regime, so they could deny the bombing and killing of little kids and first responders.\n\nAnyway, just look at the marks on the wall. Look the he height they arrive. firing squats do not aim so high or so low. Only indoctrinated people can believe it.\n\nIf you want to know about what happened, read my previous comment:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/l9il1y/child_playing_on_the_bomb_marks_left_in_a_wall_83/gli7m0m/",
