The UK manufacturing capacity cannot produce the EU supply of 40 million doses in Q1 no matter how many the EU take, nor would it make a measurable dent if split.\n\nGreat, since 24 million doses per quarter would not make a measurable dent in a 40 million requirement if split, and since it's such an insignificant amount not worth arguing over, then let's split them.\n\n&gt;Further, the UK have contributed massive amounts of money (\u00a312 bln across all the vaccine initatives) [towards research, manuacturing, and rollout.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/covid-vaccines-to-cost-u-k-almost-16-billion-watchdog-says). It's estimated that this [is 7x more per capita than the EU](https://www.ft.com/content/c9bbc753-97fb-493a-bbb6-dd97a7c4b807). This is not the UK somehow solely benefiting from the EU cash, the UK have contributed massive amounts to this.\n\nI wholly appreciate UK put money towards the vaccines in general, and also into AstraZeneca in particular. But UK contribution towards the AstraZeneca vaccines at the heart of this controversy has not been exclusive. Yet it is receiving 100% of its order and 100% of UK plant output where the EU is forced to take exclusive cuts to its orders. This does not seem equitable to me. But it is the illogical gloating of UK posters that really gets me. \"Well we invested earlier, so you're clearly idiots expecting that your contractual, paid for obligations are going to be met, also you don't deserve any deliveries if you're such huge idiots.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And why isn't this an issue? They push Article 16 before releasing what a massive fuck up it is. Do you hoenstly not see a single problem with the EU procurement process?\n\nThe issue is: you can not have both, gloating over untouchable supply, and simultaneously horror at someone else protecting their supply. You can't insist to keep 100% of the production on basis of nationalism and UK national rights and contractual priority in spite of other contractual obligations, then simultaneously be outraged at some universal humanistic principle being broken when EU looks out for its own by also demanding its own contracts are fulfilled first, before others' are. This is the reddit reactions I am talking about.\n\nCriticism of Article 16 being triggered is a different thing, and also very silly, but I don't care to get into details of something that no longer matters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The UK is itself involved with the BioNTech supply chain with supply [of lipids for the vaccine production](https://www.cityam.com/british-chemicals-firm-strikes-100m-deal-with-pfizer-to-produce-covid-vaccine/). The UK isn't hoarding anything, they are using as many vaccines as their own manufacturing output can produce. Introducing export controls will end up incredibly messy, espically if others retaliate.\n\nUK is currently keeping 100% of vaccine output created in the UK despite contractual obligations of suppliers to provide for the EU. This is what I call hoarding.\n\nIn an unrelated story, export controls apply to ready made vaccines from suppliers that aren't meeting their contractual obligations inside the EU. This doesn't matter to UK lipids or German vials or what have you. As a matter of fact, this isn't impacting Pfizer supply into the UK either. UK residents now being supplied with German manufactured vaccines, while rest of Europe gets fuck all of UK vaccines.",

Even the current total isn't close to that (and it includes other vaccines other than AZ). \n\nI think the UK politicians have been advised to stay quiet on that front especially since this was framed by the EU as a legal matter. The normally vocal Boris has been tight-lipped and even Article 16 only resulted in a 'grave concerns', rather playing the victim for Ireland.  So I think the UK government are trying to diffuse. They're also probably worried export controls will be enforced. You can sometimes win points when someone messes up by helping them rather than pointing out their mistakes.\n\nConfronting politicians with mistakes they've made rarely results in anything other than anger and counter accusations anyway. Article 16 was a mistake (no apology), ordering vaccines 1/4 year later than others, was mistake (no responsibility). \n\nRealising you have to wait on the vaccine... start criticising the vaccine. Most of it is distraction and politicians doing a bad job trying to reapportion blame. \n\nHopefully people don't forget to apportion blame for the number of UK deaths at BJ's feet either.

Individual member states are legally incapable of signing trade deals with the rest of the world. If they could, the single market and customs union would become useless overnight.\n\n&gt;However, French Polynesia and New Caledonia are controversial since there have been calls for referendum. \n\nThere have already been two referendums in New Caledonia regarding independence, both of which favoured remaining. The next, and last one, is scheduled for 2022. There has been a shift towards independence, but it's impossible to say what the result will be by then.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that thanks to the fact that they are still part of France, they now have equal access to the EU's vaccine procurement scheme. It may have its hiccoughs now, but neighbouring Fiji and Vanuatu can only dream of this privilege. New Caledonians will undoubtedly take note of this soon.\n\nAFAIK there have been no significant calls for actual independence in French Polynesia.\n\n&gt;On the other side, Pitcairn relies on the UK support as shown with the legal trials with the sexual abuse. It was the UK governor of Pitcairn that forced the mayor (who was also facing sexual abuse chatges) to stepped down.\n\nThe reason I wrote my initial comment is to point out the fact that virtually zero percent of the UK's economic activity is situated in the Pacific region. Anyone who has a notion of the gravity theory of international trade will realize that the benefits to the UK economy will be rather minimal compared to the economic harm it's inflicting on itself by leaving the EU single market.",

    "body": "Britain will prioritise offering spare vaccines to Ireland once stocks are secured for the UK jab rollout, The Telegraph understands.\n\nMinisters are examining sharing vaccines with other countries in order \"to protect us and the rest of the world\" as soon as supplies for the domestic vaccination programme are assured, a Government source said. \"The Common Travel Area falls into that category,\" the source added. \"If Ireland was still experiencing shortfalls, we absolutely would.\"\n\nIn the wake of a row with the EU about vaccine supplies which on Friday saw the bloc forced to climb down from plans to impose a border on the island of Ireland, Boris Johnson said he wants Europe and the rest of the world to receive vaccinations \"at the same time\".\n\nIn a People's PMQs, filmed on Sunday, he said \"there is no point one country on its own getting vaccinated\", adding: \"Britain, the UK, we can't think of this just as a project for us and us alone.\n\n\"We want to make sure as many people across Europe, across the whole world, get access to vaccines... We want everybody in our country to get vaccinated at the same time as the vaccination of everybody in the world, because that is ultimately the only way to fix this.\"\n\nWhile Britain's vaccination programme is ahead of the rest of the world, opening up international travel will be difficult and there will be a continued risk of the emergence of new Covid variants.\n\nNo doses would be sent out of the UK before the Government's target to offer a jab to all over 50s by mid-spring is met, it is understood. Any offer to share vaccines would depend on the volumes delivered to Britain in coming months and the country's ability to fulfil Mr Johnson's aim of vaccinating all UK adults by the autumn.\n\nIreland is considered a priority because it shares a land border with Northern Ireland. The Brexit talks established that the island of Ireland was a \"single epidemiological unit\" for the purpose of animal health and welfare, and Government insiders believe the same logic applies to human health.\n\nOn Sunday night, Downing Street sources warned that it was too early for decisions about sending vaccines abroad and stressed that the Government's focus was on vaccinating the most vulnerable.\n\nAnother Government source suggested that, once the UK is in a position to share vaccines, a balance would be struck between offering supplies to wealthier nearby neighbours and poorer developing countries further afield.\n\nThe remarks echoed those made by Liz Truss, the International Trade Secretary, who on Sunday said the UK wants to work with overseas partners to overcome Covid. She said it would be damaging to become a \"vaccinated island\" while other countries go without jabs because, in that scenario, the virus would continue to spread.\n\nThe UK is eventually set to have a surplus of stock, having ordered 367 million doses of vaccine from seven different developers although not all have been approved so far. But Ms Truss said: \"Of course, we first need to make sure that our population is vaccinated. We have a target to get the most vulnerable vaccinated by mid-February.\"\n\nAsked whether the UK would aid allies and developing nations before autumn and the completion of the domestic vaccine programme, she replied: \"There have been supply issues so we need to make sure the new drugs that are coming online are delivered, the population is vaccinated.\"\n\nMinisters have agreed to a \"reset\" in relations with the EU after Brussels imposed export controls on vaccines, with the bloc suffering supply shortages from pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca.\n\nOn Friday, the European Commission reversed its controversial plans to override part of the Brexit agreement on Northern Ireland to control shipments of jabs, which risked a hard border with the Republic. The Irish premier Michael Martin said on Sunday that the EU had used the \"wrong mechanism\" and he should have been informed before the move was made.\n\nOn Sunday, Ursula von der Leyen, the EU Commission president, tweeted that a \"step forward on vaccines\" had been made. She wrote: \"@AstraZeneca will deliver 9 million additional doses in the first quarter (40 million in total) compared to last week's offer &amp; will start deliveries one week earlier than scheduled.\"\n\nEU leaders who have already threatened legal action against the UK over the vaccines dispute shifted to targeting AstraZeneca over the weekend as they sought an outlet for public anger over vaccine delays.\n\nThe firm, which makes the Oxford jab, has said it will deliver 4.6 million doses to France by the end of March \u2013 half the amount initially agreed upon.\n\nClement Beaune, the French Europe minister, threatened sanctions against the Anglo-Swedish company if it emerged that Britain had been given priority, saying on Sunday: \"If there is a problem and other countries have been favoured \u2013 for example the UK over us \u2013 then we will defend our interests. \n\n\"Contracts are not moral commitments, they are legal commitments. Penalties or sanctions can be triggered in every contract.\"\n\nSanctions being considered include withholding payments, cancelling subsequent orders and seeking compensation for a breach of contract. Mr Beaune said an investigation into vaccine deliveries to Britain by EU factories was under way.\n\nIt came as Berlin and Rome issued similar threats to vaccine providers. \"If we find out that individual companies are not maintaining their side of the bargain then we'll have to make a decision on legal measures,\" Peter Altmaier, the German economy minister, told Die Welt newspaper.\n\nMeanwhile, the French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, seemed to soften his government's stance on the AstraZeneca jab, following Emmanuel Macron's claims that it was ineffective in the over-65s.\n\nMr V\u00e9ran said: \"By giving its authorisation on Friday, the European Medicines Agency specified that it could be used on all adults, despite incomplete data on those over 65. It added that additional studies of efficacy in the elderly were expected in February.\"\n\nHe said France's health regulator, the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9, would decide on whether to approve the vaccine on Tuesday",

Many countries have multiple languages, and many languages are spoken in multiple countries.\n\nIn this case, English is the defacto national language of the entire United Kingdom, but it's only one of a handful of \"ethnically British\" languages spoken in the UK. Wales has Welsh, Scotland had both Gaelic and Scots, and Northern Ireland has some Irish (although sadly at this point very little). On top of that, you've also got Cornish, a local Romani dialect, as well as British Sign Language (which is obviously difficult to depict on this chart, but shows you the relatively limited ideas of languages that we have sometimes).\n\nGerman is another good example. The chart doesn't differentiate between Germany and Austria, but they do speak different dialects of German, so it seems unfair to lump then under the same banner. However, Germany also contains multiple regional minority languages, so is it even so fair to use the German flag when the chart isn't even close to describing the languages found in that nation?",

People still like traditional architecture overwhelmingly (this very thread proves it), 100 years of modernism has not made it anymore popular than it was when it was first unveiled.\n\nSays you. People like to watch old architecture but living in it and building it are different things. As Americans say put your money where your mouth is. Look what private people build for their homes it's not neo-romanesque (in my native language it's closer to neoromantism) but it's modern. Also modernism ended somewhere in 70ties with last breath in 80ties replaced by post modern or PoMo which I loathe. \n\n&gt; Which is your personal, small niche fetish. If we compare the number of users of the said buildings who like them, and those who'd prefer any traditional design, the former would be in a small minority. \n\nAgain what people like to watch and where they really want to live are different things. They put money not where they loudly applied. I can easily find you hundreds of old 100-150 year old houses under 100k euros why do you think they get abandoned when for same money people build new?\nI own apartment in 120 year old house I had to rip everything to bare bricks. My in-laws lived in 400 year old manor house(small one check in Google images \"dworek polski\") and it was like a pit from hell opened in their pocket. Yes it's lovely to look, to visit on sightseeing trip holding hands whispering \"how lovely it would be to own such place...\". But when people vote with their money they choose modern designs.\n\n&gt; Yet the designers, in cabal with the construction industry and their marketing departments to promote their soulless hackjobs as The Chic and *\"the only way to go or else!\". And then we have people like you, who complain that the plebs don't fall in love with it. How dare they!\n\nWhere did I complained about people taste? If people would want Romanesque architecture they would build it. Majority of buildings in my country but also in my part of Europe are built by future owners so you babling about cabals has nothing to do. Because if people would like they would just go to architect that would design them what they like. And for some time in early 90ties my country was flooded with what we call Gargamels houses with towers with fake styrofoam stone walls and columns at entrances you won't see many new buildings in this style.\n\n\n&gt;The labor cost is not much cheaper than it was before in comparison.\n\nLabour cost is much higher!\n\n&gt; I am involved in the industry and the cost of unionized metal\\glazing workers installing the curtainwalls, let alone concrete forming labour - is extremely expensive, more so than brick masons doing a comparable size job. \n\nOh my god brickmasons here are still mainstay of every building. We rarely build with sticks like people do overseas. Building with bricks has nothing to do if you build traditional or modern it's finishing that kills! Look at that library how many superb woodworkers would you need for that level of finish? Outside it probably has hundreds of fine stonemason works. You could extrude it or even 3d print but it will look tacky the level of finish that this library in picture has costs gigantic money.\n\n&gt; The costs were generally inflated *precisely* because the modernist designers killed them, refusing to design traditional buildings so most of the contractors that could work with traditional materials went bankrupt.\n\nYes just like cars killed carriage industry those damn car designers forced people to buy cars and carriage industry went out of business. Grow up if modernism wouldn't be liked then it wouldn't be requested by owners and build for them. It was family Tugendhat that hired Mies van der Rohe not some designer forcing them to build it. \n\n&gt; And yet, there are many traditional projects being built all over the world right now, and the costs are very much comparable. Most of the contemporary modernist buildings are designed in a dysfunctional way, with a lot of wastage, and rack up the truly **massive** costs for maintenance. The difference in price between traditional and modernist design for any given building is thus very often within 10% at most.\n\n Lol you really don't know how much stone columns, gargoyles and other things cost, how much copper draining costs ceramic roof tiles(that need heavier roofing) or god forbid slate. Not to mention upkeep. Just replacing main doors in my in-laws manor house cost more than average monthly pay heavy almost 3m high oak double doors I could replace every door in modern house for same price. And don't get me started on windows my MIL gets murderous anytime she speaks about freaking traditional windows \n\n&gt; Before you cry that it is exactly the usual profit margin - the contractor would get his 10% regardless. The developers and investors would have to pay a tiniest bit more, but of course given that they invest from overseas, completely isolated from the structures they build - they don't care in the slightest what is being built as long as it is the cheapest, laziest design possible. It is up to the citizens of a city to impose regulation, design criteria to force the new structures to conform to local needs, local culture, local urban fabric. Which is what precisely we are starting to do at this moment in many cities, such as in Germany - in Dresden, Potsdam, L\u00fcbeck.\n\nIt's not 10% I when I was selling bathroom finishings I wouldn't go below 15% and average was closer to 25% starting point was +35% but just so I could let clients haggle it down. But you also don't get real costs of building in 18th or 19th century style as on the picture above. You also don't get the costs of upkeep of such structures. High ceilings are bitch to heat in winter and bitch to cool in summer. Wooden finishing like this is nightmare to run cables with modern you have ceiling space to hide cables that library needs. They are also not cheap to repair or replace with modern you just get bit of paint.",

And yet those reading it aloud, in either language or in its original English, would finish at roughly the same time. This peculiar phenomenon is the subject of new research which finds that languages face a trade-off between complexity and speed. Those packed with information are spoken slower, while simpler ones are spoken faster. As a result, most languages are equally efficient at conveying information.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/09/28/why-are-some-languages-spoken-faster-than-others\n\nScientific source Abstract;\n\n&gt;We studied a sample of 17 languages from 9 language families spread across Europe and Asia, showing a remarkable diversity in terms of linguistic and typological features at all levels, from phonetics and phonology to morphology and syntax and to semantics and pragmatics (see table S1). Focusing on their phonetics and phonology, these languages vary in their number of phonemes (from 25 in Japanese and Spanish to more than 40 in English and Thai), the number of distinct syllables (from a few hundred in Japanese to almost 7000 in English), tonal complexity (from none to six contrastive tones), and various other phonological phenomena (e.g., vowel harmony is present in Finnish, Hungarian, Korean, and Turkish). Thanks to its size and diversity, this sample is adequate to reveal robust trends reflecting phenomena that can potentially be extrapolated to human language in general.\n\nhttps://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/9/eaaw2594",

This is \"contractual power\". They ask you to stand on one foot, you do it. They ask you to shout \"I'm an idiot\" very loudly, you do it without hesitating.\n\nThe small companies I've worked for weren't really capable of producing that much. And you cannot say anything in front of the customer that implies you doubt being able to keep up with the demand, they'll just sign with someone else if you do.\n\nHowever, you can ask for support. \"In order to meet this deadline I need....\". Sure, they have lots of resources, so they can get whatever you need: suppliers for a particular component at a low cost, experts as consultants, financement at low interest rates, or even advances in payments. Of course everything is negotiated and they'll ask you to justify all your demands.\n\nI was never directly involved in negotiations but my managers have always been doing this in front of my eyes. And customers did call me, personally, their attitude on the phone was pretty much like \"my foot is itchy\" and I was supposed to do something about it immediately. The customer is in another country? I get loaded into an airplane just like I were a box.\n\nBTW private companies also behave this way if they are big enough. It's just a matter of being an important customer and knowing it. In fact, my experience in a project for an important car manufacturer was definitely very stressing and probably even worse than government bodies.\n\nAll that being said, the European Commission is ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE bigger than any customer I've worked with. I'm really surprised they didn't handle vaccine producers. Pfizer says it's upgrading its plant in Belgium in order to raise the production rate. I'm like... WTF? In all projects I've worked with we were expected to do that MONTHS before start of delivery. And the contract with Pfizer was signed in August last year.\n\nI'm definitely surprised.

So much for the facts we have.\n\nWhen we look into the future, there is a lot of speculation involved. Maybe in a few weeks we will have the South African mutation here and all our previous vaccination efforts were uselss. We simply don't know. Let's hope it goes well (Britain has zero advantages when the EU programme fails and vice versa), let's work for a success but of course consider the possibility that there might be more obstacles.\n\nAnd when it comes to the EU, one has to say that the programme was extremely heterogeneous so far. France, unfortunately, has not been very successful. I hope for them that they will improve but that lies primarily within France.

That isn't the UK having a massive increase in cases, thats the virus mutating to be more transmissible and getting around. We're just the ones who were paying attention and noticed it!\n\nIts the EU commission who fucked up, and signed a contract 3 months later than it should have done, with a agreement that simply states \"We will try our best to get these doses from EU plants only\".\n\nIts even more absurd you think we're trying to \"Hog all the vaccine\", when its EU politician's saying they will impose export barriers on the vaccine going to countries like Japan and Canada, meanwhile we're announcing that as soon as we get everyone over 50 sorted, we're just going to pour all our vaccine pool into Ireland to get those guys sorted as well!",

    "body": "&gt;Says you. People like to watch old architecture but living in it and building it are different things. As Americans say put your money where your mouth is. \n\nI own and live in a pre-modernist building. I also grew up in a modernist building, and *from my own experience* I can tell that the difference is *drastic*. Pre-modernist apartments have greater floor area on average, taller ceilings, let alone the quality of finishes, traditional urban streetscape and facade. In just about any city in Europe, pre-modernist houses, apartments - are top real estate. No modernist contemporary block, let alone from the 50-70s, can ever stand a chance to compete in terms of a price.\n\n&gt;Look what private people build for their homes it's not neo-romanesque (in my native language it's closer to neoromantism) but it's modern.\n\nVery much wrong. When people have ability to choose (often they don't), they pick large, traditional-looking houses, even though often they can't properly articulate what they'd like - which leads to McMansions, but it is showing where the heart goes. In the realm of corporate mass production of real estate, people's tastes do not come into equation - they have exactly zero influence on what is being built, the demand is therefore not connected to supply. By the way, what the heck do you even mean by bringing Neo-Romanesque? Neither me nor anybody else brought Neo-Romanesque, and this hall in OP picture is sure as hell not of this style. Do you even know what Neo-Romanesque is?\n\n&gt;Again what people like to watch and where they really want to live are different things. They put money not where they loudly applied. I can easily find you hundreds of old 100-150 year old houses under 100k euros why do you think they get abandoned when for same money people build new? I own apartment in 120 year old house I had to rip everything to bare bricks. My in-laws lived in 400 year old manor house(small one check in Google images \"dworek polski\") and it was like a pit from hell opened in their pocket. Yes it's lovely to look, to visit on sightseeing trip holding hands whispering \"how lovely it would be to own such place...\". But when people vote with their money they choose modern designs.\n\nSee above. When you pick some place in a shithole region which has exactly zero business activity going on, naturally the prices will drop and low-maintenance will lump up. That proves absolutely nothing. You have to compare buildings in larger, more prosperous cities and towns, especially somewhere where there is a less of a supply of pre-war housing (due to war damage or what not). There you see the *staggering* difference in costs.\n\n&gt;Where did I complained about people taste? If people would want Romanesque architecture they would build it. Majority of buildings in my country but also in my part of Europe are built by future owners so you babling about cabals has nothing to do. Because if people would like they would just go to architect that would design them what they like. And for some time in early 90ties my country was flooded with what we call Gargamels houses with towers with fake styrofoam stone walls and columns at entrances you won't see many new buildings in this style.\n\nOf course they couldn't - there is a lack of designers and contractors able to do the job. There is literally a handful designers in Europe left who could design a traditional building. The academia makes sure that only one sort of aesthetic approach is being taught, everything else denounced as heresy. Obviously in such environment you will not find a designer that can do an educated design and advise for you. \n\n&gt;Labour cost is much higher! Oh my god brickmasons here are still mainstay of every building. We rarely build with sticks like people do overseas. Building with bricks has nothing to do if you build traditional or modern it's finishing that kills! Look at that library how many superb woodworkers would you need for that level of finish? Outside it probably has hundreds of fine stonemason works. You could extrude it or even 3d print but it will look tacky the level of finish that this library in picture has costs gigantic money.\n\nLabour cost is not much higher *in comparison* to material cost today, when compared to pre-war situation. The inflation has brought up the number of zeroes in your prices, but the gross margin is the same.\n\n&gt;Yes just like cars killed carriage industry those damn car designers forced people to buy cars and carriage industry went out of business. Grow up if modernism wouldn't be liked then it wouldn't be requested by owners and build for them. It was family Tugendhat that hired Mies van der Rohe not some designer forcing them to build it.\n\nThose \"damn car designers\" did force the people to buy cars. It was a calculated cooperation between the industries, well known from history, it has never been a secret. New urban design that forced the dominance of car traffic, long distances of travel, separation of city functions, low-density urbanism - and at the same time killing of the public transportation - all led to a basically mandatory proliferation of a car. You get it or you're screwed. The wounds delivered by the post-war \"experts\" in urban planning will take a century to mend. Contemporary urban planning is just starting this work as of now. \n\n&gt;Lol you really don't know how much stone columns, gargoyles and other things cost, how much copper draining costs ceramic roof tiles(that need heavier roofing) or god forbid slate. Not to mention upkeep. Just replacing main doors in my in-laws manor house cost more than average monthly pay heavy almost 3m high oak double doors I could replace every door in modern house for same price. And don't get me started on windows my MIL gets murderous anytime she speaks about freaking traditional windows\n\nI do know, I work with that daily. They are not cheap. However long term, when properly designed, the maintenance costs would be lower than any of your typical archdaily Mies' copycat. On a large scale, look at Elbphilharmonie - for the cost it took to build it, you could make a 1:1 copy of Opera Garnier with 1:1 traditional techniques and labourers working in clown costumes - and you'd still be lower than a final project price. You have to compare apples to apples after all. But if your only argument is price, then by all means of course you can throw it all, go live in a shed or a dugout - that would certainly be even cheaper, more cost-effective, if you can come to terms with living like a rat.\n\n&gt;It's not 10% I when I was selling bathroom finishings I wouldn't go below 15% and average was closer to 25% starting point was +35% but just so I could let clients haggle it down.\n\nIt is 10% if you look at any big project today. In your small-scale it comes to a larger markup, but when we are talking about a project with a cost of $75-150,000,000.00, anything higher than 10% would not bring you many jobs to work on. \n\n&gt;But you also don't get real costs of building in 18th or 19th century style as on the picture above. You also don't get the costs of upkeep of such structures. High ceilings are bitch to heat in winter and bitch to cool in summer. Wooden finishing like this is nightmare to run cables with modern you have ceiling space to hide cables that library needs. They are also not cheap to repair or replace with modern you just get bit of paint.\n\nIts all a matter of a proper design. If you lack it, you will have problems and rack up the costs. The maintenance is a variable dependent on avoiding the conditions that lead to deterioration.",

Our healthcare system is also heavily compartmentalised so it's probably not the most efficient at this stuff, they're still ironing out some kinks there. We started later than the rest, and are now slowly picking up speed by adding different groups to the poule of people being vaccinated. First it was just critical care staff, then care home staff in a few reasons, then care home staff in all regions, then elderly people on care homes, then other people in residential care, then &gt;90yos, starting with &gt;85yos this week. Banking on the slow and steady approach I guess. We were also keeping part of the vaccine stash back for the second dose, but not as much now. \n\nThere's also an issue with different groups currently vaccinating people and they're having problems with giving timely updates to the national health service, so they've just today started using a calculation of the amount of vaccines that have been given in stead of the actual number. It shows a massive undercount in the amount of vaccines given out in all residential care (that figure hadn't been updated since last Tuesday) and a smaller but still significant undercount in the amount of vaccines given out in hospitals. So we're doing a bit better than the data suggests, but not a lot. The model puts us at about the same level as Austria here. They also still give the daily reported data of vaccines given by the national health organisation, BTW, and they'll return to showing the actual count once they get the joined registration up and running. \n\nWe've been told yesterday? I think that vaccine appointments outstrip supply deliveries the next few weeks. So we should be jabbing away the backlog soon and be rid of the stuff we have in storage now. We'll see.",
