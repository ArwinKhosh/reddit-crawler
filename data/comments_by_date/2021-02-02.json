In practice, when there is a clear majority and a strong political leader the president does nothing but appoint him/her. Instead, when everything stops working it's basically up to the president to try to restart the *engine* in one way or another. Reasons for attempting to salvage a legislature may be the most varied, if it's deemed appropriate then the president may appoint or try to appoint some *external* prime minister. Note however that the appointment must be confirmed by the parliament, so there is no way for a rogue president to appoint a rogue prime minister.
