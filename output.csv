But do you really think this stock is going to $0? Lol, we're holding shares, not options.

1) Even if I had bought in at $450 (which I didn't; I initially got in at $13.81 lol) it would have to go to $4.50/share to be -99%

Lord_Python_Of_WSB,"MM hegde the calls regardless. Because you can buy shit ton more OTM calls with the same money than ITM calls. Gamma also rises as the strike approaches ATM ( gamma is highest atm ) so delta rises faster for otm as they approach atm compare to atm going deep itm. But mainly because of the leverage otm option provide relative to itm.

Gonna make up number 

For example stock ABC trades at $50

Strike $100 is 20 cents and delta of 15 and strike $50 with delta of 50 cost is $1.5

If a large institution puts 1 million is strike 100, that's 50k option ( leverage 5 million shares ) delta is 5m x 0.15 = 750,000

MM buys 750k shares to hedge. Now if delta goes to 0.45 , the MM hedge by buying 5m x .30 delta = 1.5 million 


Now if they buy 1m strike 50 at $3 thats 6666 contracts at delta of .5 = 6.6k x 100 x 0.5 =  320k share.

If share rises the same amount since the gamma is slower than otm the delta goes to to 70, so mm hedge by buying additional 6.6k x 100 x .2 = 133k


Is in example one , 1 million in a stock with uptrend forces MM to buy 750k shares plus 1.5m = 2.25 million 

The second one they only bought 133k plus 320k = 450k

So it's a combination of the extra leverage and gamma rising faster as it approaches the option strike ( delta increases more for otm than itm or atm)",1612740125,gmit8fg,1,wallstreetbets

sjsu_dropout,"&gt; I’ve been a pure cash account, never margin enabled

All Robinhood accounts start as margin accounts by default, not a cash account.  This means all your trades were done on margin.  To convert to a cash account, you'll need to manually downgrade.

Putting everyone on margin accounts is the only way Robinhood can make their Instant money feature possible.

I was thinking of trying Robinhood awhile back but noped out as soon as I read ""[You also won’t have to wait for your funds to process when you sell stocks or make a deposit (up to $1,000)](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)"".

I thought r/wallstreetbets has the best YOLOs but I believe Robinhood has out-YOLO'ed everyone.  Most brokers have you apply for margin first and get approval if your credit rating is decent.  But Robinhood took it to whole other level by **giving everyone margin accounts automatically**.  That's just playing with fire.  I guess Robinhood never heard about what happened in 2008.",1612740166,gmitbcm,1,wallstreetbets

SU is being overlooked. They just authorized additional share buybacks starting Monday and will likely raise dividend next earnings. Their break even is $35 and they (and XOM) are sitting on some of the biggest oil assets.

Cutting out the middle man is the easiest way to more profit and if studios wanted they could open their own themed theatres where it’s not just a movie experience. Imagine a theatre with set design like universal studios. They could also host events there if they like and add them to their theme parks. For instance Disney followed suit with releasing movies to stream. They could open their own chain of Disney theatres around the world showing exclusively Disney content and not just new releases but also older Disney content. They can make it a family experience just like Disney land and they can add them to their theme parks. They would rake in all the profits aside from the employees. They would also effectively be cutting off all others to their product or they would give them access at a later date when they’re done with it.,1612740416,gmitsw0,1,wallstreetbets

bestakroogen,"First, you have neither displayed greater knowledge of the subject than I possess, nor attempted to refute anything I've said, and I've given you several launching points if you want to do so. Arrogant dismissal after a thorough refutation is an effective display of strength. Arrogant dismissal without that refutation just displays that you want to put on the veneer of strength, and that's not nearly as impressive.

I know how markets work. This is how I make my money. You aren't talking to a Leninist, or any kind of communist, or even a Berniecrat. I can agree these people have no idea how shit works. Leninists? Yeah the vanguard party is called a company, and your system is called a state monpoly. It's still capitism, it's just capitalism without the good bits. Communists? *Moneyless society?* Holy shit the delusion. Bernie? Yeah let's just let the state give everyone everything I'm sure the money won't run out. (I like Bernie best out of these three because he at least sees that the working class is exploited and is trying to fix it without destroying the concept of a market, but he's wrong to want to interfere with the freedom of the market to fix this, rather than change who has power within the market and why.) I get how the economic system works and it's not as bad as most leftists think. I wouldn't change as much about the free market system as you probably imagine.

You, however, have not displayed an understanding of economics or political theory in any sense. I'll believe outright you know about market economics, that's fair given the location of this discussion. I'm not gonna challenge you there. But before you can tell me libertarian socialism can't work, first I have to ask... without using google, in your own words, what is capitalism? What is socialism? What is communism? If you can answer those questions correctly I'm prepared to have an actual discussion about this but if you can't, you need to understand alternative economic theories to a far greater degree before you can tell me which ones can and can't work.

Second, I didn't come here to discuss leftist philosophy. I came here to see what you guys had to say about stocks. DD posts usually have good info. Someone asked why leftists would possibly think WSB was on their side, and as someone who both uses this sub and frequents leftist forums and subreddits, I had an answer for them. The rest of this discussion is in response to a stream of insults without an ounce of theoretical or rhetorical backing. 

If you want to insult my beliefs, yes, I am open to discuss economic theory. If you don't want to do that, maybe don't turn the discussion to my beliefs, because to be honest, there's a lot of places I'd love to have that discussion, and WSB is not among them. I'm here to talk about stocks. But if you want to turn the discussion to my beliefs, feel free, but back your insults up with more than just more insults so there's something to discuss, or at least so you have some backing on which to stand claiming your superior intelligence.",1612740432,gmitu0b,1,wallstreetbets

Essentially the better WSB in aggregate gets better at trading the better WSB is able to not only stick it to Wall St. but makes everyone in this sub a better trader.

WSB has so many people with so many angles on the market that it could really become a force, as long as the salty cynical people who do not really contribute anything other than making fun of people for being stupid.

If you make fun of someone for being stupid at least give them some pointers or tell them where they went wrong.",1612740559,gmiu3b2,1,wallstreetbets

noxxit,"The brokers aren't the issue. Institutions own 177% of Float. Why? Because they have been making money not by the stock increasing in value, but by lending the shares to the short sellers! The brokers only get a commission on that deal. Why would they ever recall those? For one infinity squeeze on a single stock? That would ruin their cooperation with the short sellers forever, which they basically have on all the stocks for all the time the stock market exists. The whole show is running so well they increased their shares by buying 77% of float from short sellers they are lending to.",1612740563,gmiu3l9,1,wallstreetbets

Hope it goes well for you man.
And for the rest:

I know you guys are joking, and I'm also new here. Maybe it's cuz I'm high right now man, but I can't stop worrying about the people that are not just joking about the GME thing as a whole but like just making fun of the people that actually lost money, I mean it's really worrisome thing to see.

If you’re registered and also make money part time as a Yoga Instructor you have to disclose that.  If you are politically exposed you have to disclose that.  It’s pretty basic stuff that he definitely knew.  And as you can see [here on the bottom of page 7 where it says Outside Business Activities](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/individual/individual_6054636.pdf) he listed nothing.

Additionally, my firm doesn’t allow me to be a member of any investment/stock clubs, I would assume any credible Broker/Dealer has the same rule.  Depending on the interpretation of law, you could probably say his YouTube channel qualifies as that.  What is less debatable is that those videos could be qualified as a seminar.  Any firm with any credible compliance department would not allow one of their Brokers/Principals to give a seminar that wasn’t run through compliance first to verify and confirm the content abided by the rules.

Well integrated supply and value chain. Not as exposed to shale as US producers. Goodish PR (Rip Nigeria). Strong presence in emerging markets. It’s Dutch. They know what are they doing.

But... Since you're so omnicient: Yes. I was all for holding indefinitely. The Squeeze was in retail's hands that day. Theoretically Infinite Gains wasn't a fucking joke or hyperbole, it was literally happening in front of us. That 5 to 400 crowd were Obviously making enormous gains, the pattern was a total upward spike, and people like OP got out to enjoy the rewards, but it was NOT finished. But then: a wrench. It's almost like the situation changed (imagine that) when trading was halted prematurely by Robinhood and then everyone following. Hype crashed, news was vague and opinionated, and numbers were unclear for all of us. 

You act like this was anything short of legendary. Of course FOMO would kick in for retards like me who missed the window by a year, or hell, a few months. I didn't know this place existed until two weeks ago and I watch my money and this place get torn to shreds in days.

BUT: With all this added time, the ball's not even in our court anymore. Buy, Sell, Hold, it's all up to whether or not the Index and Hedge Funds decide to cannibalize the short holders now. 

I've a limit set to 100 per for all 4. It's likely not going past that price unless a miracle happens, but it'll spike to that on market open. After that, going full retard on a couple promising penny stocks to recover, finding something good, and testing out Options. Never understood Options til now. Hopefully market open is kind on Monday.

If I see good news, I'll cancel my limit sell and hold.
If I bad news, I take the loss and reinvest.

News, not being the same 10 biased GME/Anti-GME posts that all spout the same rhetorics, of course. I want to see with my own two eyes what direction the line goes tomorrow.",1612741134,gmiv7w8,1,wallstreetbets

Netflix on the other hand are just an entertainment company. With Disney releasing Starz this year and HBO max expanding, they will come under much much more competition. If AMC is fundamentally sound, then Netflix could add a new revenue stream with theatres to hedge against their streaming service. They've also been making bigger and bigger productions so they could release in theatres for a big payday before moving it on to their streaming service.

GME cultist nuts that just keeps making things up and making it worse for everyone.

Anti GME anti conspiracy nut jobs that ignores the hundred years of market history and some of them end up saying Robinhood did nothing wrong and that media is trustworthy.

So many people show up past 14 days and talk about what is wsb suppose to be and about wsb ''Ogs'', yet past year they never shown any interest in stock trading or wsb in their rich comment and post history.

We had just about any take on it ''WSB used to be full with serious posts and DD'', ''WSB was just about playing casino, they are the hedge funds this movement despises''

or the best one ''sub used to be great without all the GME pump and dump'', first of all that it comes from accounts that been here past 14 days, second of all wsb front page has been full with GME posts past few months. Most notable was the 10th GME post that day that became the 2nd most awarded reddist post in history.

Yeah i did spend hours of scrolling post and comment history, even called out plenty, yes i am pathetic and have no life.

I think this is how **conquer and divide** works essentially, you inflate both sides of the spectrum, no need to have evil elite working against us, i think by end of the day we did it ourselves, so now we have GME nut cultists spouting whatever bs they can make up, and anti conspiracy cultists doing the same, and every normal person being repelled and drawned out.

wallstreetbetch,"The term ""conspiracy theory"" has a function similar to that served by the term “heresy” in medieval Europe. In both cases these are terms of propaganda, used to stigmatise and marginalise people who have beliefs that conflict with officially sanctioned or orthodox beliefs of the time and place in question.

It’s reasonable to suppose many of the views that are now dismissed or mocked as conspiracy theories will one day be recognised as having been true all along. Indeed, the net effect of terms such as “conspiracy theory” and “conspiracism” is to silence people who are the victims of conspiracy, or who (rightly or wrongly) suspect conspiracies may be occurring. These terms serve to herd respectable opinion in ways that suit the interests of the powerful.

Megahuts,"Well, if you still believe that the stock will go up, then it makes sense to buy more to sell later at a higher price.

So, let's say you bought 10 shares at $500.

And now the shares at at $50.

So you buy 100 more. 

This means your average cost basis is $90.90 &lt;$10,000 / 110&gt;.

So, now when the stock goes back up to say, $150, you can choose to exit the position ""in the green"". Whereas if you only held your original 10 shares, you would have to wait until the price comes back to $500 to exit in the green. 

Using the above as an example, you could even sell 1 covered call with a $90 strike price, and generate some income / reduce your average cost even further. 

For example, I bought in on Friday at $70. So I sold a covered call for Feb 19th at a $70 strike for a $15 premium. Therefore, the average price form my shares is now $55. 

So, there are still things you can do to improve your situation, as long as you believe your investment thesis is solid.",1612741832,gmiwiwk,1,wallstreetbets

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If the majority sells at a small squeeze and at the same time the HF's decide to close the positions totally the story is over. We will have some gains, not so bad and it's over.  
&gt;  
&gt;The likelihood that the HF will proceed shorting the stock with new positions is high. Therefore it can happen that we do a squeeze yoyo until a mega squeeze at which a lot of HF just go bankrupt.

Just_Learned_This,"Bet they will soon enough. That mindset is starting to pay off for then. Reddit has grown a bunch since 2019 and so has their income. Ads are more frequent, so is the money spent on awards, reddit premium. 

They're beginning to make some cash on their popularity, whether it's enough for profit, I don't know or care to look up the numbers but my guess based on my observations would be they made much more money in 2020 than 2019 or prior. Whether that money is thrown back into the company or not determines whether they start to turn a profit or double down on growth.",1612742092,gmix0gt,1,wallstreetbets
